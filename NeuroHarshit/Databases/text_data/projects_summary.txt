## Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition
Duration: Nov 2024 - Dec 2024
Description: A GUI based software, recognizes Handwritten digits. Built and trained the CNN model from scratch on the MNIST dataset, without relying on pre-trained weights. User can draw digits, add noise, change pensize and import/export the prediction history. Program displays metrics like Probability Distribution, Accuracy, Confidence, Confusion Matrix, and Correct V/S Wrong Predictions. Intuitive buttons, shortcuts, and toggles for seamless user experience.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Pillow, CustomTkinter, scikit-learn, PyInstaller, Matplotlib, Tkinter, Pickle, and inno setup builder.
Keywords: Custom Model, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, GUI, Model Deployment

## Project: Human Emotion Detection:
Duration: Mar 2025 – Mar 2025
Description: A computer vision project that detects human facial emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Explored multiple architectures including LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-34. Achieved ~64% accuracy on the FER2013 dataset with VGG-16 after applying data augmentation and fine-tuning. This project was my first step into deep learning for computer vision and gave me strong practical insights into model architecture design, overfitting, and transfer learning.
Future Work: Plan to revisit this project with improved architectures (EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, Xception), improved dataset and better fine-tuning strategies after gaining more experience.  
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Keywords: Custom Model, Deep Learning, Real-time Computer Vision Pipeline
