- Keywords for NueroHarshit: RAG, AI Agent, Portfolio, GUI

3. Human Emotion Detection:
- Duration of Human Emotion Detection: Mar 2025 – Mar 2025
- Description of Human Emotion Detection: A computer vision project that detects human facial emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Explored multiple architectures including LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-34. Achieved ~64% accuracy on the FER2013 dataset with VGG-16 after applying data augmentation and fine-tuning. This project was my first step into deep learning for computer vision and gave me strong practical insights into model architecture design, overfitting, and transfer learning.
- Future Work for Human Emotion Detection: Plan to revisit this project with improved architectures (EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, Xception), improved dataset and better fine-tuning strategies after gaining more experience.  
- Technologies Used in Human Emotion Detection: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- Main Challenge of Human Emotion Detection: Training the CNN
- Real world use case of Human Emotion Detection: Useful in customer service (detecting customer emotions in real time), healthcare (supporting mental health monitoring), Security & Surveillance (Can identify suspicious behavior based on emotional cues).
- Keywords for Human Emotion Detection: Custom Model, Deep Learning, Real-time Computer Vision Pipeline
