It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed or new ones added in vivo.\nThe technique is considered highly significant in biotechnology and medicine as it enables editing genomes in vivo and is precise, cost-effective, and efficient. It can be used in the creation of new medicines, agricultural products, and genetically modified organisms, or as a means of controlling pathogens and pests. It also offers potential in the treatment of inherited genetic diseases as well as diseases arising from somatic mutations such as cancer. However, its use in human germline genetic modification is highly controversial. The development of this technique earned Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. The third researcher group that shared the Kavli Prize for the same discovery, led by Virginijus Šikšnys, was not awarded the Nobel prize.\nWorking like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of DNA to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via homology directed repair (HDR), is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches. This allows for the introduction of targeted DNA damage and repair. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template. This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for the repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9 result from the repair of the double-stranded break by means of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or POLQ/polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). These end-joining pathways can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site, which may disrupt or alter gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR-Cas9 gives researchers the ability to generate targeted random gene disruption.\nWhile genome editing in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed had proven to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a large scale. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing became possible. Cas9 derived from the bacterial species Streptococcus pyogenes has facilitated targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells by allowing for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRNA guide strands. Researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA with ease in order to silence or cause point mutations at specific loci. This has proven invaluable for quick and efficient mapping of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes. Newly engineered variants of the Cas9 nuclease that significantly reduce off-target activity have been developed.\nCRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques have many potential applications. The use of the CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA complex for genome editing was the AAAS's choice for Breakthrough of the Year in 2015. Many bioethical concerns have been raised about the prospect of using CRISPR for germline editing, especially in human embryos. In 2023, the first drug making use of CRISPR gene editing, Casgevy, was approved for use in the United Kingdom, to cure sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia.. On 2 December 2023, the Kingdom of Bahrain became the second country in the world to approve the use of Casgevy, to treat sickle-cell anemia and beta thalassemia. Casgevy was approved for use in the United States on December 8, 2023, by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Other methods ===\nIn the early 2000s, German researchers began developing zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. ZFNs have a higher precision and the advantage of being smaller than Cas9, but ZFNs are not as commonly used as CRISPR-based methods. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the design and creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a much more difficult and time-consuming process than that of designing guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires synthesizing only a short RNA sequence, a procedure that is already widely used for many other molecular biology techniques (e.g. creating oligonucleotide primers).\nWhereas methods such as RNA interference (RNAi) do not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, ZFNs, and TALENs provide full, irreversible gene knockout. CRISPR can also target several DNA sites simultaneously simply by introducing different gRNAs. In addition, the costs of employing CRISPR are relatively low.\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\nIn 2005, Alexander Bolotin at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) discovered a CRISPR locus that contained novel Cas genes, significantly one that encoded a large protein known as Cas9.\nIn 2006, Eugene Koonin at the US National Center for Biotechnology information, NIH, proposed an explanation as to how CRISPR cascades as a bacterial immune system.\nIn 2007, Philippe Horvath at Danisco France SAS displayed experimentally how CRISPR systems are an adaptive immune system, and integrate new phage DNA into the CRISPR array, which is how they fight off the next wave of attacking phage.\nIn 2012, the research team led by professor Jennifer Doudna (University of California, Berkeley) and professor Emmanuelle Charpentier (Umeå University) were the first people to identify, disclose, and file a patent application for the CRISPR-Cas9 system needed to edit DNA. They also published their finding that CRISPR-Cas9 could be programmed with RNA to edit genomic DNA, now considered one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.\n\n\n=== Patents and commercialization ===\nAs of November 2013, SAGE Labs (part of Horizon Discovery group) had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models. By 2015, Thermo Fisher Scientific had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits.\nAs of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools. As companies ramped up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR could be quickly monetized were raised. In 2014, Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and nine others were awarded US patent number 8,697,359 over the use of CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing in eukaryotes. Although Charpentier and Doudna (referred to as CVC) were credited for the conception of CRISPR, the Broad Institute was the first to achieve a \"reduction to practice\" according to patent judges Sally Gardner Lane, James T. Moore and Deborah Katz.\nThe first set of patents was awarded to the Broad team in 2015, prompting attorneys for the CVC group to request the first interference proceeding. In February 2017, the US Patent Office ruled on a patent interference case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the Broad Institute, and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California.\nShortly after, University of California filed an appeal of this ruling. In 2019 the second interference dispute was opened. This was in response to patent applications made by CVC that required the appeals board to determine the original inventor of the technology. The USPTO ruled in March 2022 against UC, stating that the Broad Institute were first to file. The decision affected many of the licensing agreements for the CRISPR editing technology that was licensed from UC Berkeley. UC stated its intent to appeal the USPTO's ruling.\n\n\n=== Recent events ===\nIn March 2017, the European Patent Office (EPO) announced its intention to allow claims for editing all types of cells to Max-Planck Institute in Berlin, University of California, and University of Vienna, and in August 2017, the EPO announced its intention to allow CRISPR claims in a patent application that MilliporeSigma had filed. As of August 2017 the patent situation in Europe was complex, with MilliporeSigma, ToolGen, Vilnius University, and Harvard contending for claims, along with University of California and Broad.\nIn July 2018, the ECJ ruled that gene editing for plants was a sub-category of GMO foods and therefore that the CRISPR technique would henceforth be regulated in the European Union by their rules and regulations for GMOs.\nIn February 2020, a US trial showed safe CRISPR gene editing on three cancer patients.\nIn October 2020, researchers Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in this field. They made history as the first two women to share this award without a male contributor.\nIn June 2021, the first, small clinical trial of intravenous CRISPR gene editing in humans concluded with promising results.\nIn September 2021, the first CRISPR-edited food went on public sale in Japan. Tomatoes were genetically modified for around five times the normal amount of possibly calming GABA. CRISPR was first applied in tomatoes in 2014.\nIn December 2021, it was reported that the first CRISPR-gene-edited marine animal/seafood and second set of CRISPR-edited food has gone on public sale in Japan: two fish of which one species grows to twice the size of natural specimens due to disruption of leptin, which controls appetite, and the other grows to 1.2 times the natural average size with the same amount of food due to disabled myostatin, which inhibits muscle growth.\nA 2022 study has found that knowing more about CRISPR tomatoes had a strong effect on the participants' preference. \"Almost half of the 32 participants from Germany who are scientists demonstrated constant choices, while the majority showed increased willingness to buy CRISPR tomatoes, mostly non-scientists.\"\nIn May 2021, UC Berkeley announced their intent to auction non-fungible tokens of both the patent for CRISPR gene editing as well as cancer immunotherapy. However, the university would in this case retain ownership of the patents. 85 % of funds gathered through the sale of the collection named The Fourth Pillar were to be used to finance research. It sold in June 2022 for 22 Ether, which was around US$54,000 at the time.\nIn November 2023, the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) became the first in the world to approve the use of the first drug based on CRISPR gene editing, Casgevy, to treat sickle-cell anemia and beta thalassemia. Casgevy, or exagamglogene autotemcel, directly acts on the genes of the stem cells inside the patient's bones, having them produce healthy red blood cells. This treatment thus avoids the need for regular, costly blood transfusions.\nOn 2 December 2023, the Kingdom of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA) became the second in the world to approve the use of Casgevy, to treat sickle-cell anemia and beta thalassemia.\nIn December 2023, the FDA approved the first gene\n\n---\n\nIndex: 2\nTitle: CRISPR\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR\nContent: CRISPR (; acronym of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. Each sequence within an individual prokaryotic CRISPR is derived from a DNA fragment of a bacteriophage that had previously infected the prokaryote or one of its ancestors. These sequences are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of heritable, acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and open up specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within living organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Repeated sequences ===\nThe discovery of clustered DNA repeats took place independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from Osaka University researcher Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the \"iap\" gene (isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase) from their target genome, that of Escherichia coli. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersing different sequences. They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.\nIn 1993, researchers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened in the direct repeats among different strains of M. tuberculosis and used this property to design a typing method called spoligotyping, still in use today.\nFrancisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain studied the function of repeats in the archaeal species Haloferax and Haloarcula. Mojica's supervisor surmised that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division, because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time; this was the first full characterization of CRISPR. By 2000, Mojica and his students, after an automated search of published genomes, identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family. Because those sequences were interspaced, Mojica initially called these sequences \"short regularly spaced repeats\" (SRSR). In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who were searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to unify the numerous acronyms used to describe these sequences. In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of Archaeoglobus fulgidus were transcribed into long RNA molecules subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.\nIn 2005, yogurt researcher Rodolphe Barrangou discovered that Streptococcus thermophilus, after iterative phage infection challenges, develops increased phage resistance due to the incorporation of additional CRISPR spacer sequences. Barrangou's employer, the Danish food company Danisco, then developed phage-resistant S. thermophilus strains for yogurt production. Danisco was later bought by DuPont, which owns about 50 percent of the global dairy culture market, and the technology spread widely.\n\n\n=== CRISPR-associated systems ===\nA major advance in understanding CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by four homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems, cas 1–4. The Cas proteins showed helicase and nuclease motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci. In this publication, the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern, but its function remained enigmatic.\n\nIn 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids. In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously attacked the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR-cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria. All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared in other journals.\nThe first publication proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica and collaborators at the University of Alicante, predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the RNA interference system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.\nExperimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published. A CRISPR region in Streptococcus thermophilus acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of S. thermophilus to different types of phages by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages. In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins called Cascade, that in E. coli cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules called CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex. Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of S. epidermidis targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent conjugation. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in Pyrococcus furiosus. A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts strands of both phage and plasmid DNA in S. thermophilus.\n\n\n=== Cas9 ===\n\n \nA simpler CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes uses the protein Cas9, an endonuclease functioning with two small RNAs—crRNA and tracrRNA—to form a four-component complex. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier simplified this into a two-component system by fusing the RNAs into a \"single-guide RNA\", enabling Cas9 to target and cut specific DNA sequences—a breakthrough that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. Parallel work showed the S. thermophilus Cas9 could be similarly reprogrammed by altering the crRNA sequence. These developments spurred genome editing efforts, including demonstrations by groups led by Feng Zhang and George Church showing genome editing in human cells using CRISPR-Cas9.\n\n\n=== Cas12a ===\n\nCas12a, a Class II Type V CRISPR-associated nuclease, was characterized in 2015 and was formerly known as Cpf1. This nuclease is found in the CRISPR-Cpf1 system of bacteria such as Francisella novicida. The initial designation, derived from a TIGRFAMs protein family definition established in 2012, reflected the prevalence of this CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cas12a exhibits several key distinctions from Cas9: it generates staggered cuts in double-stranded DNA, in contrast to the blunt ends produced by Cas9; it relies on a 'T-rich' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (typically 5'-TTTV-3', where V is A, C, or G), offering alternative targeting sites compared to the 'G-rich' PAMs (typically 5'-NGG-3') favored by Cas9; and it requires only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for effective targeting, whereas Cas9 necessitates both a crRNA and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA).\n\n\n=== Cas13a ===\n\nIn 2016, the nuclease (formerly known as C2c2) from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii was characterized by researchers in Feng Zhang's group at MIT and the Broad Institute. Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, which means that it does not cleave DNA, but only single-stranded RNA. Cas13 is guided by its crRNA to a ssRNA target and binds and cleaves the target. Similar to Cas12a, the Cas13 remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssRNA molecules non-discriminately. This collateral cleavage property has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.\n\n\n== Locus structure ==\n\n\n=== Repeats and spacers ===\nThe CRISPR array is made up of an AT-rich leader sequence followed by short repeats that are separated by unique spacers. CRISPR repeats typically range in size from 28 to 37 base pairs (bps), though there can be as few as 23 bp and as many as 55 bp. Some show dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a stem-loop ('hairpin') in the RNA, while others are designed to be unstructured. The size of spacers in different CRISPR arrays is typically 32 to 38 bp (range 21 to 72 bp). New spacers can appear rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection. There are usually fewer than 50 units of the repeat-spacer sequence in a CRISPR array.\n\n\n=== CRISPR RNA structures ===\n\n\n=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===\nSmall clusters of cas genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 cas genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the cas core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the cas core.\nCRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI. The 6 system types are divided into 33 subtypes. Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a \"signature gene\" found almost exclusively in the category. Classification is also based on the complement of cas genes that are present. Most CRISPR-Cas systems have a Cas1 protein. The phylogeny of Cas1 proteins generally agrees with the classification system, but exceptions exist due to module shuffling. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components. The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR-Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR-Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\n\nCRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, conjugation and natural transformation by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.\n\n\n=== Spacer acquisition ===\nWhen a microbe is invaded by a bacteriophage, the first stage of the immune response i\n\n---\n\nIndex: 3\nTitle: Editas Medicine\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editas_Medicine\nContent: Editas Medicine, Inc., (formerly Gengine, Inc.), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company which is developing therapies for rare diseases based on CRISPR gene editing technology. Editas headquarters is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and has facilities in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n\n== History ==\nEditas Medicine was originally founded with the name \"Gengine, Inc.\" in September 2013 by Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute, Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and George Church, David Liu, and J. Keith Joung of Harvard University, with funding from Third Rock Ventures, Polaris Partners and Flagship Ventures; the name was changed to the current \"Editas Medicine\" two months later. Doudna quit in June 2014 over legal differences concerning intellectual property of Cas9.\nIn August 2015, the company raised $120 million in Series B funding from Bill Gates and 13 other investors. it went public on 2 February 2016, via an initial public offering that raised $94 million.\nThe company entered into a strategic collaboration with Juno Therapeutics in 2015 to combine its CRISPR-Cas9 technology with Juno's experience in creating chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor therapeutics to the end of developing cancer therapeutics. Juno was later acquired by Celgene, which was in turn acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb.\nThe company announced in 2015 that it was planning a clinical trial in 2017 using CRISPR gene editing techniques to treat Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10), a rare genetic illness that causes blindness. On 30 November 2018, the FDA gave permission to start the trials,  under the investigational name EDIT-101 (also known as AGN-151587).  In September 2021, a statement from Editas claimed that preliminary results from clinical trials were promising and support clinical benefits of EDIT-101 treatment.\nIn March 2020, Editas, in partnership with Allergan, was the first to use CRISPR to try to edit DNA inside a person's body (in vivo). As part of the clinical trial, a patient who was nearly blind as a result of Leber's congenital amaurosis received an intravitreal injection containing a harmless virus carrying CRISPR gene-editing instructions. Five months later, Editas reworked its deal with Allergan's owner AbbVie and regained full rights to their range of eye disease treatment therapies, including EDIT-101 for the treatment of LCA10.\nIn 2019, the company was building new chemistry facilities in Boulder, Colorado.\nKatrine Bosley was CEO until 2019, when she was replaced by board member Cynthia Collins. Collins was replaced  in 2021 by James Mullen, who had been board chairman. Gilmore O'Neill, former CMO of Sarepta Therapeutics, became CEO on June 1, 2022, with Mullen staying on as executive chairman of the board. On December 12, 2024, Editas ended the development of reni-cel and laid off 65% of its employees.\n\n\n== Research ==\nEditas works with two different CRISPR nucleases, Cas9 and Cas12a.\nEDIT-101 is a CRISPR based gene therapy for treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis, which is currently in clinical trials.\nEDIT-301 is an experimental  potential treatment  utilizing the firm's CAS 12a editing technology for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. In 2019 the firm reported early success in research on the drug;. In December 2020, it filed an IND application for treatment of sickle cell disease.  In January 2021, it said it had received clearance from the FDA for phase 1 safety studies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n---\n",

They exploit their inherent ability to make precise and efficient\ngenetic alterations Doudna and Charpentier (2013); Jinek et al. (2012). The CRISPR\nlocus is characterized by repetitive base sequences interspersed with spacers derived\nfrom past viral and plasmid invaders. This locus is transcribed into a long precursor\nCRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), which is then processed into mature guide RNAs (crRNAs).\nThese crRNAs direct the Cas proteins to cleave complementary sequences in invading\ngenetic elements, thereby providing adaptive immunity. Among the various CRISPR-Cas\nsystems, CRISPR-Cas9 of Type II has attracted significant attention due to its simplicity\n⋆Corresponding author: condybao@gmail.com\narXiv:2409.05938v1  [q-bio.QM]  9 Sep 2024\n2\nCondy Bao1 Fuxiao Liu2\nFig. 1: The Overall Architecture of DeepFM-Crispr.\nand versatility in genome editing. It employs a dual-RNA structure consisting of crRNA\nand trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), guiding the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA\ntargets Jinek et al. (2012); Doudna and Charpentier (2014).\nCRISPR-Cas12, a Type V system, offers unique advantages over Cas9 by utilizing a\nsingle RNA for both CRISPR array processing and target DNA recognition. This system\ncleaves target DNA in a staggered manner, increasing the diversity of editable sequences\nand enhancing the potential for multiplex editing. Another innovative addition to the\nCRISPR toolkit is CRISPR-Cas13, which targets RNA instead of DNA, facilitating not\nonly gene modulation without altering the genome but also enabling novel diagnostic\napplications due to its collateral cleavage activity upon target recognition Gootenberg\net al. (2017). The specificity and efficacy of guide RNA design are crucial for maximizing\non-target actions and minimizing off-target effects, which are particularly concerning\nwith Cas9’s potential DNA off-targets and Cas13’s RNA-targeted collateral activity\nAbudayyeh et al. (2017). CRISPR screens, including those for viability and FACS-\nsorting, have become instrumental in evaluating the effectiveness and specificity of\nCRISPR systems. These screens employ a multitude of guide RNAs to ascertain factors\ninfluencing knockout efficiency and to refine guide designs to balance activity and\nspecificity Doench et al. (2016). Unlike tools focused solely on CRISPR-Cas9, those\ndesigned for Cas13 must account for RNA secondary structures, significantly impacting\nguide RNA efficiency Wessels et al. (2020).\nTo address challenges related to data scarcity and the complexity of integrating\nstructural and evolutionary information, we introduce DeepFM-Crispr. This model\nleverages advanced transformer-based architectures and large language models, which\nhave revolutionized fields ranging from natural language processing Liu et al. (2023a,\n2024, 2023b); Li et al. (2023) to bioinformatics due to their ability to handle large\ndatasets and extract deep, contextual relationships within data. Our transformer Vaswani\net al. (2017) model processes a wide array of inputs, offering a predictive score for\non-target efficiency based on enriched representations of evolutionary and structural\ninsights. Validated against a dataset of 22,599 Cas13d sgRNAs Cheng et al. (2023),\nDeepFM-Cas13d outperforms conventional machine learning methods and existing\nprediction tools, particularly in targeting non-coding RNAs Shmakov et al. (2015).\nDeepFM-Crispr: Prediction of CRISPR On-Target Effects via Deep Learning\n3\n2\nMethod\nOur methodology integrates multiple deep learning architectures and data represen-\ntation techniques to predict the on-target efficiency of sgRNAs based on their sequences\nand secondary structures. This approach harnesses the power of large language models,\nconvolutional networks, and transformer encoders to process and analyze the complex\nbiological data. The details of DeepFM-Crispr shown in Fig. 1.\n2.1\nData Representation\nsgRNA sequences were encoded using a one-hot encoding scheme, where each\nnucleotide (A, C, G, U) is represented by a binary vector. The vectors for adenine (A),\ncyto- sine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) are respectively [1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0],\nand [0,0,0,1]. This methodological choice ensures a uniform input structure for all\nsequences, facilitating the computational handling of genetic data across diverse sgRNA\nsamples. By transforming the nucleotide sequences into binary vectors, the model can\neffectively learn from the positional and compositional nuances of the sgRNA without\nthe biases and variances inherent in raw textual data.\nThe one-hot encoded vectors serve as the primary input for the subsequent layers of\nthe machine learning architecture. They are fed into a series of deep learning models\nthat are designed to extract and learn complex patterns and relationships. This initial\nrepresentation forms the basis for all further transformations and feature extractions\nperformed by the RNA large language model and other components of our predictive\nframework. The standardized format ensures that each sgRNA is represented in a consis-\ntent manner, allowing the deep learning algorithms to focus on learning the underlying\nbiological mechanisms rather than adjusting to variations in data format.\n2.2\nRNA Large Language Model\nRNA-FM Chen et al. (2022) is designed as an end-to-end deep learning model\nthat efficiently extracts latent features from RNA sequences and leverages an attention\nmechanism to capture contextual information. It features 12 layers of transformer-based\nbidirectional encoder blocks equipped with positional embeddings. This structure allows\nRNA-FM to accurately discern the positional context of ncRNA sequences. The encoder\nwithin RNA-FM utilizes self-attention and feedforward connections to generate complex\nrepresentations that integrate context from every sequence position. Furthermore, the\nmodel is adept at constructing pairwise interactions between nucleotides, enhancing\nits ability to depict direct nucleotide-nucleotide interactions and providing a nuanced\nrepresentation of the input data. These capabilities make RNA-FM particularly effective\nin correlating internal representations with RNA secondary structures. As a result, the\nmodel produces high-dimensional embeddings for each sgRNA Abudayyeh et al. (2017),\nencapsulating both local and global contextual relationships within the sequences. These\nembeddings are subsequently utilized as inputs for further predictive modeling to deter-\nmine sgRNA efficacy scores, and also serve as inputs for a secondary structure prediction\nmodel, enhancing our understanding and prediction of RNA structural configurations.\n4\nCondy Bao1 Fuxiao Liu2\n2.3\nSecondary Structure Prediction\nThe secondary structure of each sgRNA was predicted using a ResNet model Krishna\net al. (2017) that processes inputs derived from the RNA-FM representations. This model\noutputs a probability matrix where each nucleotide position is labeled as either paired\n(1) or unpaired (0). These binary sequences are then further processed using a deep\nconvolutional network based on the ResNet architecture, which is particularly adept at\ncapturing spatial hierarchies in structured data He et al. (2016). This approach allows for\neffective integration of contextual and spatial information, enhancing the accuracy of the\nsecondary structure predictions for the sgRNAs.\n2.4\nFeature Integration and Processing\nThe embeddings from the RNA-FM and the outputs from the secondary structure\nprediction ResNet are integrated and further processed to refine the feature representation.\nDenseNet architecture. Seq-DenseNet Wei et al. (2021) and SS-DenseNet Zhao\net al. (2021), was employed to process integrated features. This architecture benefits\nfrom dense connectivity patterns that improve the flow of information and gradients\nthroughout the network, aiding in the robust learning of features from both sequence and\nstructural data Wei et al. (2021).\nPositional Encoding Transformer Encoder. The output embedding of RNA-FM\nare passed through a positional encoding transformer encoder. This module incorporates\npositional encodings to the input features to maintain the sequence order, which is crucial\nfor capturing dependencies that are positionally distant in the sgRNA sequence. The\ntransformer encoder refines these features by focusing on the most relevant parts of the\nsgRNA for efficacy prediction Huang et al. (2017).\n2.5\nEfficacy Prediction\nThe final prediction of sgRNA efficacy is performed using a multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) Riedmiller and Lernen (2014). The MLP comprises an input layer that receives\nthe processed features, several hidden layers with non-linear activation functions to\ncapture complex relationships in the data, and an output layer that produces a continuous\nefficacy score for each sgRNA.\n3\nDataset\nTo explore the efficiency and specificity of the Cas13d system, we performed a\ncomprehensive two-vector CRISPR/Cas13d proliferation screen on the A375 melanoma\ncell line, guided by protocols from a well-established benchmark study Cheng et al.\n(2023). The screening library consisted of 10,830 sgRNAs targeting a total of 426 genes,\nincluding 192 protein-coding genes and 234 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This\nselection included 94 essential genes and 14 non-essential genes, previously identified\nin A375 cells via RNA interference and CRISPR-based screenings. Our library design\naimed to robustly model the efficiencies of Cas13d sgRNAs, allocating approximately\nDeepFM-Crispr: Prediction of CRISPR On-Target Effects via Deep Learning\n5\nFig. 2: Comparison Result between DeepFM-Crispr with baselines.\n30 guides per gene. This strategy was intended to overcome potential biases observed\nin previous tiling screens that were limited to only 2-3 genes, thereby enhancing the\nrepresentativity of the sgRNA library.\nFollowing the screening, sgRNA abundance was quantitatively assessed through high-\nthroughput sequencing.

Current trends emphasize the urgent need\nfor advanced methods and technologies to detect public health threats, including diseases and viral agents. Gene and RNA editing\ntechniques enhance the ability to identify, modify, and ameliorate the effects of genetic diseases, disorders, and disabilities. Viral\ndetection and identification methods present numerous opportunities for enabling technologies, such as CRISPR, applicable to both\nRNA and gene editing through the use of specific Cas proteins. This article explores the distinctions and benefits of RNA and gene\nediting processes, emphasizing their contributions to the future of medical treatment. CRISPR technology, particularly its adaptation via\nthe Cas13 protein for RNA editing, is a significant advancement in gene editing. The article will delve into RNA and gene editing\nmethodologies, focusing on techniques that alter and modify genetic coding. A-to-I and C-to-U editing are currently the most\npredominant methods of RNA modification. CRISPR stands out as the most cost-effective and customizable technology for both RNA\nand gene editing. Unlike permanent changes induced by cutting an individual’s DNA genetic code, RNA editing offers temporary\nmodifications by altering nucleoside bases in RNA strands, which can then attach to DNA strands as temporary modifiers.\nIndex Terms—Gene editing, RNA editing, CRISPR technology.\n✦\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nGenetic mutations contribute to a wide variety of dis-\neases and viruses. They can be inherited from the parents\nor acquired throughout an individual’s life [1]. Mutations\noccur when a complementary base is altered or there is a\ncomplete loss in gene expression [2]. Effects of sequence\nalteration can be harmless, helpful, or hurtful depending on\nhow the mutation modifies the individual’s genetic makeup\n[3]. Nonetheless, mutations can be more damaging to DNA\ndue to their permanence to a cell’s structure than a mutation\nis to RNA and protein molecules which have multiple\nsynthesized copies [2]. Depending on where they occur and\nwhether they alter the function of essential proteins, gene\nmutations affect human health in various ways [4].\nThe scope of this article is to inform readers of the\nresearch methods, enabling technologies, and applications\nof gene and RNA editing to mutations, and the benefits\nof RNA and gene editing advancements to the future of\nthe medical and technological fields. Current traditional ap-\nproaches of prescribed pharmaceuticals modify the course\nof a disease but do not provide a cure [5]. Traditional\nmedicines do not treat or modify the root of disease, which\nis found in the DNA of a genome. Rather than administering\nchemically-modified medications to patients, gene and RNA\nediting provides a new, more holistic pathway due to its\nability to edit the naturally-occurring genetic process within\nthe human body. The purpose of gene and RNA editing is\nto modulate the root of disease by fixing the gene’s DNA\nM. Aledhari is with the Data Science, University of North Texas, Denton, TX\n76207 USA.

Under a microscope,\nDNA’s double helix looks like a twisting ladder with linking\nand repeating steps that consist of the genetic codes, the\nbasis of an individual’s existence. The particular sequence\nof the links are the building blocks of information that tells\nus about the individual, like their ancestry and their current\nstate or biological condition, including the possibilities of\nfuture biological reactions and functions.\nThe pattern within the double helix links specific nu-\ncleotides, or chemical units of genetic material, to one an-\nother. Nucleotides consist of three parts: a 5-carbon sugar\nmolecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing\nbase. Nucleotides that virtually bond together within DNA’s\ndouble helix are adenosine (A) and thymine; guanine (G)\nand cytosine (C). These are the base pairs that duplicate in\na variety of sequences. The DNA double helix follows the\nrules of chargeoff making the number of G and A equal to\nthe numbers of C and T [7].\nDNA is a memory bank and an instructor for develop-\nment, reproduction, and survival [8]. As a memory bank,\nDNA possesses vital information concerning the organism,\nor the individual, and it keeps the information similar to\nhow computers store data. As an instructor, DNA conveys\nstored information to create new cells and proteins for\nbiological functioning.\nAn important property of DNA is its ability to replicate.\nTo make copies of itself, the double helix unwinds and\nduplicates the base sequences [1]. New cells are created\nafter replication and division from the parent cell. As DNA\narXiv:2409.09057v1  [q-bio.GN]  1 Sep 2024\nREVIEW ARTICLE , VOL. XX, NO. XX, AUGUST 2024\n2\ncontinually copies the stored genetic information, it commu-\nnicates that same information to new daughter cells. New\ncells possess the same abilities as the parent cell, and can\nthereby repeat the replication and instruction processes.\nDNA does not actively apply information [9]. In order\nfor DNA to transfer instructions for biological processes,\nthe double helix needs a messenger. DNA doesn’t leave the\nsafety of the cell’s protective membrane-bound organelles,\nlike the mitochondria and chloroplast, or the cell’s nucleus,\nalso known as the brain of a cell; this is where RNA steps\nin. RNA is a conduit, a pilot, that drops in. It connects with\nthe split double helix, and obtains instructions from genes\nand/or DNA to create proteins necessary for biological\nfunctions in the body. However, the creation of a protein\ndiffers from replication in that the RNA strand does not\nremain bonded to DNA [10].\nA similar, yet more functional piece of DNA is a gene.\n“Only a functional piece of DNA is called a gene” [7]. It\nmakes up one % of DNA’s sequence [8]. A gene is a specific\ntrait consisting of DNA [7]. Not all genes possess DNA,\nand not all DNA is considered a gene. Genes only contain\ninherited information, like if your parents have brown eyes\nand you have brown eyes, that is an hereditary gene passed\ndown from your parents and/or their parents before them.\nWithin a human individual, there are a two copies of each\ngene to represent each parent [1].\nGenes can consist of either DNA or RNA, and they serve\nas a trait regulator. These specific sequences code genetic\ninformation from parent to child [11]. Genes that contain\ninherited DNA also have the ability to replicate and call\nmessengers to deliver its stored information to the rest of\nthe body. As a result, both DNA and genes contribute to the\ncreation of proteins for the biological processes.\nSince DNA and genes are limited to specific locations in\nthe cell, messengers of RNA come to aid in the process of\nprotein creation. Protein molecules are the workhorses, the\nengine in the entire body [12]. Gene expression is a function\nof DNA “by which cells read out, or express, the genetic\ninstructions in their genes” [10]. Two major steps of the gene\nexpression process are transcription and translation [4].\nRNA is the carrier of DNA information. As a single,\nshort strand consisting of a ribose sugar, RNA is more\nflexible than DNA [9]. It capable of folding into a variety\nof shapes [10]. From the storage facility of DNA, mRNA\n(or messenger RNA) carries the blueprints for the protein\nengine [9]. Similar to the structure of DNA, RNA contains\ncomplementary bases of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine\n(G), and uracil (U). Uracil (U) substitutes for DNA’s thymine\n(T) base, because it is resistant to oxidation as RNA leaves\nand exists outside of the cell’s nucleus.\nTranscription is the first step in creating proteins. After\nunwinding and splitting the double helix, a DNA strand\nserves as a template for complementary base-pairing be-\ntween nucleotides [10]. An enzyme connects to and pro-\ncesses the strand forming mRNA, a single-strand copy of\nDNA, or a gene’s DNA [12]. Once RNA is released from\nDNA, many more copies of that RNA strand can be created\nand sent out while still containing the original DNA instruc-\ntions. “A transcription unit typically carries the information\nof just one gene, and therefore codes for either a single RNA\nmolecule or a single protein” [10].\nGene expression is completed with its second step of\ntranslation. After moving out of the nucleus, the genetic\ncode, or blueprint, of mRNA is translated and read by\ntRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA) forms\nbonds between the amino acid groups of codons to produce\npolypeptide chains. Every three nucleotides on the mRNA\nstrand are read as a group of three called codons. These\nthree lettered codes translate into specific amino acids,\nor instruct the cessation of protein creation. “The mRNA\nsequence is thus used as a template to assemble—in or-\nder—the chain of amino acids that form a protein” [12].\nHuman individuals, and all organisms, are born with a\ngenetic code pre-written into the body, strands of informa-\ntion, known as nucleotides, imbedded in DNA and RNA\nsequences that is translated into proteins, or amino acid\nsequences, by living cells [13]. Mutations cause changes to\nDNA sequences away from the normal and stable sequence\n[14]. While traditional therapies and medications supply\ntemporary relief, pharmaceuticals impose on the natural\nsystem of our bodies, forcing, even to the degree of im-\npeding the body to change, causing numerous debilitating\nside effects. Medications are currently not capable of solving\npermanent genetic mutations that cause impediments and\ndiseases without negatively impacting the individual. This\nshortcoming is most apparent when treating monogenic\ndiseases, diseases caused by inherited mutations to a single\ngene [5]. Whereas gene and RNA editing provide targeted\ntherapies that lead to a painkiller lasting days or weeks\nwhile remaining nonaddictive and reversible [6].\nDifferent to traditional medicines and surgery, gene and\nRNA editing technologies engineer cells that possess cura-\ntive properties administered to a range of diseases that cur-\nrently have no cure [5]. These technologies and therapies are\n“living drugs” that can heal and modulate damaged tissues\nor diseased organs [5]. Currently gene and RNA therapies\nare not so different in delivery from other existing medi-\ncations [15]. Engineered cells are encapsulated, then, they\nare prescribed and taken regularly, however, their effects\ndo not last indefinitely like that of conventional medicines\n[15]. Methods of gene and RNA editing recognizes the\ndifferences and similarities of the two techniques. The meth-\nods are similar because RNA editing derives from gene\nediting technologies. Gene editing modifies DNA strands\nwithin an individual’s genome with a cut and deletion of\nthe mutation, while RNA editing sends a messenger to\nDNA and converts the nucleic acid bases. For this reason,\nresearchers have transitioned their focus to RNA editing due\nto its temporary off-target mutations, making RNA editing\na potentially safer alternative to gene editing [6].\nOther reasons to limit use of gene editing methods are\nthat it can cause a negative immune response from cells,\nand thereby cause more pain to a patient or even cause\nmore debilitations, like cancer, if targeting is not efficient.\nResearchers have evidence that gene editing enz\n\n---\n\nIndex: 3\nTitle: CRISPR-GPT for Agentic Automation of Gene-editing Experiments\nPublished: 2025-08-21\nAuthors: Yuanhao Qu, Kaixuan Huang, Ming Yin, Kanghong Zhan, Dyllan Liu, Di Yin, Henry C.

However, creating an effi-\ncient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex\nexperimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\npromise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve\nbiological design problems.\nIn this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent aug-\nmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process\nof CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments.

It was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing\nsystem that bacteria use as an immune defense. Beyond CRISPR-Cas9, recent advancements have\nled to the development of CRISPR activation/interference, CRISPR-based prime editing and base\nediting technologies. CRISPR activation/interference, also called CRISPRa/CRISPRi, are able\nto either enhance gene expression or silence the activities of specific genes via epigenetic regula-\ntion [40, 20, 29, 33, 38]. Prime editing, considered a ”search and replace” method for DNA, allows\nfor precise editing capabilities without introducing double-stranded breaks [7]. Base editing, on the\nother hand, enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one DNA base into another at targeted\nlocations, further expanding the toolkit for precise genome modification [19]. All these technologies\nhold potential for broad applications in medicine, agriculture, and beyond, enhancing the scope of\ngenome editing in pursuing treatments for genetic diseases and other applications.\nDesigning gene-editing experiments requires deep understanding of the suite of technologies and\nthe associated biology of target organs. CRISPR Cas-based editing works by interacting with the\nRNA of a short ”guide” sequence (guide RNA) that binds to a specific target sequence in a cell’s\nDNA, much like the RNA segments bacteria produce from the CRISPR array. When introduced\ninto cells, the guide RNA recognizes the intended DNA sequence, and the Cas enzyme (often Cas9\nor others) cuts the DNA at the targeted location, mirroring the process in bacteria. There are\n2\nnumerous considerations when designing such experiments, including the selection of a well-suited\ngene-editing system, the development of optimal guide sequences, and validation approach. This\ntypically requires significant domain expertise, understanding of biology of the target organ, as\nwell as trial-and-error efforts. Developing AI-assisted computation tools to aid gene-editing holds\ngreat promise to make the technology more accessible and accelerate both scientific and therapeutic\ndevelopments.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language skills and\nencapsulate a tremendous amount of world knowledge, approximating aspects of artificial general\nintelligence [13, 24, 3, 5, 4]. Recent research has also explored enhancing LLMs with external tools,\nimproving their problem-solving abilities and efficiency [53, 32, 44]. LLMs have also demonstrated\npotential as tool makers [10] and black-box optimizers [52]. Researchers have explored LLM-based\nspecialized models for various application domains [31, 51], as well as for solving scientific and\nmathematical tasks.\nFor example, ChemCrow [9] uses tool-augmented LM for solving a range\nof chemistry-related tasks such as paracetamol synthesis, whereas Coscientist [8], also driven by\nGPT-4 and integrated automated experimentation, achieved successful optimization of palladium-\ncatalyzed cross-coupling reaction.\n1.1\nGeneral-purpose LLMs do not know how to design biological experiments.\nWhile leveraging large language models (LLMs) for aiding in the design of gene-editing exper-\niments presents an enticing prospect, the current state-of-the-art general-purpose models exhibit\nsignificant shortcomings in this specialized domain. These models, despite their vast knowledge\nbase, lack the precise, up-to-date domain-specific knowledge essential for the accurate design of\nbiological experiments.\nA critical limitation of general-purpose LLMs is their propensity for ”hallucinations” or gen-\nerating confident yet inaccurate responses when tasked with specialized biological queries.\nFor\ninstance, when tasked with designing a guide RNA (gRNA) sequence for targeting specific human\ngenes, such as EMX1 or EGFR, general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT-3/ChatGPT-4 can respond\nincorrect sequence with high confidence. However, the gRNA sequences they provide often do not\ncorrespond to any known genomic region. This discrepancy can be readily identified by comparing\nthe LLM-generated sequences with reference sequences in databases such as the NCBI’s BLAST\ntool, which aligns sequences to the human genome and transcriptome. Such hallucinated design\nsequences not only lack utility but can mislead researchers, potentially leading to wasted resources\nand time if not properly vetted.\nIn addition, responses generated from general-purpose LLMs usually lack essential details neces-\nsary for the experimental design, such as specific materials, protocols, considerations for off-target\neffects, gRNA efficiency, and specificity. Such gaps in information can leave researchers, especially\nthose new to the field of gene editing, unprepared for the practical execution of experiments.\nFurthermore, it is crucial to note that responses generated may contain overwhelming infor-\nmation that does not directly contribute to the gene-editing experimental designs. Such irrelevant\ntext can lead to confusion and misdirection, complicating the researcher’s task of identifying the\nmost pertinent and practical information for their gene-editing objectives.\nAll of these limitations underscore the necessity for a new class of LLMs tailored specifically\nfor the gene-editing experimental designs (We refer readers to Appendix A for more examples of\nfailures). Such models would need to integrate deep, accurate domain knowledge with the ability\nto critically evaluate and generate experimentally viable solutions, thereby overcoming the current\n3\nbarriers faced by general-purpose LLMs in the design of CRISPR gene-editing experiments.\n1.2\nOverview of CRISPR-GPT\nIn the rapidly evolving field of genetic engineering, CRISPR technology has become a piv-\notal tool for precise gene editing. Despite its promise, the intricacy of designing CRISPR exper-\niments—from guide RNA (gRNA) selection to predicting off-target effects—presents significant\nchallenges, especially to those new to the field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, a\nnovel solution that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain-specific\nknowledge and computational tools, specifically tailored for CRISPR gene editing tasks.\nCRISPR-GPT is centered around a tailor-made LLM-powered design and planning agent (Fig-\nure 1). This engine of the agent not only draws upon expert knowledge from leading practitioners\nin gene editing but also integrates a broad review of recent literature and a suite of computational\ntoolkits including guideRNA design tool.\nThe innovation of CRISPR-GPT Agent allows automated designs of gene-editing experiments\nby simplifies the complex process into a series of manageable steps:\n• Selection of CRISPR System: Tailoring the choice of CRISPR system to the experiment’s\nneeds.\n• gRNA Design: Optimizing guide RNA sequences for efficiency and specificity based on the\nBroad Institute’s gold-standard guideRNA library and CRISPRPick toolkit, including pre-\ndesigned gRNA libraries [28, 14, 15, 43].\n• Delivery Approach Selection: Advising on the most effective methods to introduce the CRISPR\ncomponents into target cells.\n• Prediction of Off-target Effects: Assessing potential unintended alterations alongside desired\nedits.\n• Recommendation of Experimental Protocols: Outlining step-by-step procedures tailored to\nthe experiment’s objectives.\n• Validation Approach Recommendation and Primer Design: Recommending gest ways to val-\nidate the edits and help design the associated primers.\nThis approach, leveraging a chain-of-thought reasoning model and state machines, ensures that\neven individuals new to gene editing can iteratively refine their experimental designs to achieve\nprotocols that meet their specific research needs. In addition, CRISPR-GPT offers:\n• A Freestyle Q&A Mode for addressing ad hoc queries with precision,\n• An Off-target Prediction Mode for in-depth analysis of pre-designed gRNAs.\nThese functions help the users when they meet additional issues during the experimental design\nprocess.\nMindful of the ethical and s\n\n---\n",

    "## Basic mechanism and molecular components\n\nCRISPR-based genome editing repurposes a prokaryotic adaptive immune system (CRISPR-Cas) to target and modify nucleic acid sequences in living cells by guiding an effector nuclease with a short RNA (guide RNA) to a complementary sequence, thereby creating site-specific cleavage or enabling base modification strategies [1,2]. The guide RNA may be provided as a native dual-RNA system (crRNA + tracrRNA) or as an engineered single-guide RNA (sgRNA) depending on the effector, and the precise RNA–DNA (or RNA–RNA) complementarity determines targeting specificity [1,2]. These programmable nucleases can thus be used either to introduce targeted double-strand breaks that harness cellular repair pathways for sequence disruption or insertion, or to bring enzymatic activities to a locus for direct base modification without inducing a break [1,2].\n\nDifferent CRISPR effector proteins offer distinct biochemical behaviors that expand the range of editing outcomes. Cas9 (Class II, Type II) recognizes target DNA adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and, when guided by dual RNAs or an sgRNA, introduces double-strand breaks that are often blunt-ended in many systems, enabling subsequent cellular repair-mediated alterations [1,2]. By contrast, Cas12a (Cpf1) uses a single crRNA, recognizes T-rich PAMs such as 5'-TTTV-3', and generates staggered (sticky) double-strand breaks, which alters the types of repair junctions formed and expands targeting options relative to Cas9 [2]. The Cas13 family comprises RNA-guided RNA nucleases that target single-stranded RNA rather than DNA; some Cas13 variants exhibit collateral, non-target RNA cleavage upon activation, a property that has been repurposed both for diagnostics and for transient RNA modulation that does not alter genomic DNA [2,4].\n\nThe CRISPR systems themselves are modular at the genetic and protein levels. Genomic CRISPR arrays, consisting of a leader sequence, repeats, and spacers, encode a heritable memory of prior invaders, while Cas proteins carry out the molecular stages of adaptation (spacer acquisition), CRISPR RNA processing, and interference [2]. Different CRISPR classes and types achieve these tasks with distinct architectures: Class 1 systems employ multi-protein complexes for interference, whereas Class 2 systems rely on single, multidomain effector proteins, a distinction that has practical implications for delivery and engineering of editing tools [2].\n\n### Targeting and cleavage mechanics\n\nTarget recognition by DNA-targeting CRISPR effectors depends critically on two determinants: complementarity between the guide RNA and the target sequence, and the presence of an appropriate protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target. Precise base pairing within a seed region of the guide is particularly important for specificity and for preventing off-target activity [1,2]. These molecular constraints shape guide design and influence the likelihood of successful cleavage at the intended locus [1,2].\n\nFollowing recognition, Cas9 produces double-strand breaks whose cellular outcomes are dictated by the host repair machinery. Repair primarily proceeds via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ), which commonly generate small insertions or deletions (indels) useful for gene disruption, or via homology-directed repair (HDR) when a donor template is provided, enabling precise insertions or sequence replacement (knock-ins) [1]. Thus, the same programmable cleavage event can be leveraged for either gene knockout or precise genome modification depending on the repair context and the presence of donor templates [1].\n\nCas12a’s distinct cleavage chemistry—producing staggered cuts—and its requirement for T-rich PAMs permit alternative insertion strategies and multiplexing designs. The staggered ends produced by Cas12a alter the spectrum of repair outcomes and can facilitate different insertion architectures compared with the blunt-ended cuts often made by Cas9. Additionally, Cas12a’s guide architecture and cleavage pattern enable design strategies for simultaneous targeting of multiple sites, thereby expanding experimental and therapeutic possibilities [2].\n\n### RNA-targeting with Cas13\n\nCas13 enzymes are RNA-guided ribonucleases that specifically target single-stranded RNA molecules when programmed with appropriate CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), allowing transient modulation or degradation of transcripts without altering genomic DNA [4]. Upon activation by target binding, some Cas13 variants exhibit collateral cleavage of bystander RNAs, a feature that has been exploited for sensitive nucleic acid diagnostics but that necessitates careful design and control when Cas13 is considered for therapeutic RNA modulation to avoid unintended transcriptome-wide effects [4].\n\nRNA-targeted editing and modulation approaches, including programmable A-to-I or C-to-U conversions and Cas13-based transcript knockdown, are attractive because they produce non-permanent changes, thereby reducing risks associated with permanent genomic edits [5,4]. The efficacy of Cas13-mediated RNA targeting is strongly influenced by structural features of the RNA, such as secondary structure, which affect guide accessibility and target recognition; these structural considerations are therefore central to guide design and to predicting functional outcomes in RNA-targeting applications [5,4].",
    "## DNA repair pathways and editing outcomes\n\nDouble-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by programmable nucleases are processed by endogenous cellular repair pathways, and the pathway engaged largely determines the molecular outcome of the edit. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and polymerase theta–mediated end-joining (TMEJ) commonly resolve DSBs into small insertions and deletions (indels), which frequently disrupt coding sequences and are therefore effective for generating gene knockouts [1]. Homology-directed repair (HDR), by contrast, can incorporate an exogenously supplied homologous donor template to install precise sequence changes (knock-ins), but HDR is largely restricted to dividing cells and generally exhibits lower efficiency than end-joining pathways in many somatic contexts [1].\n\nTo reduce the complications associated with DSBs, researchers have developed nickase-based (DSB-sparing) approaches that retain a Cas-derived DNA-targeting module but minimize or avoid generating two-ended DSBs. Base editors couple cytosine or adenine deaminases to a Cas9 nickase to chemically convert one base to another within a constrained editing window without introducing a DSB [6,5]. Prime editors combine a Cas9 nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to perform a programmable “search-and-replace” at the target site, enabling installation of precise edits while creating fewer DSBs and reducing reliance on HDR [6,5].\n\nThe choice of repair pathway and thus the spectrum of editing outcomes is influenced by biological and technical variables. Cell type and cell-cycle stage modulate the relative activities of HDR versus end-joining pathways, local chromatin context can affect target accessibility and repair dynamics, and the molecular configuration of the nuclease cut (for example blunt versus staggered ends) biases pathway engagement [1,5]. Investigators exploit these dependencies through strategies such as delivery timing, cell-cycle manipulation, donor design, and engineering of editor properties to favor either disruptive end-joining outcomes or templated sequence replacement as required by the experimental objective [1,5].\n\n### HDR vs end-joining: practical considerations\n\nHDR enables precise insertion or replacement of sequences by using a homologous donor template, making it the method of choice when exact sequence changes or tagged alleles are required [1]. However, HDR is inefficient in many somatic cell types, which restricts its practical utility; consequently, experimental strategies aimed at increasing HDR frequency include synchronizing cells to HDR-permissive cell-cycle phases, optimizing donor template format and delivery, and employing engineered nuclease variants that may bias repair toward templated outcomes [1,5].\n\nIn contrast, NHEJ and TMEJ are predominant and more active repair routes in most cell types and therefore provide a more reliable means to generate gene knockouts [1]. These end-joining pathways produce heterogeneous indel spectra rather than a single defined product; therefore, understanding the typical range and frequency of indel outcomes at a given target is important both for predicting phenotypic consequences and for designing appropriate validation assays to confirm functional disruption [1].\n\n### Base and prime editing summary\n\nBase editors, consisting of cytosine or adenine deaminases fused to a Cas9 nickase, enable efficient conversion of single bases within a defined editing window without creating DSBs, making them well suited to correct certain point mutations [6,5]. Their applicability is limited to the specific base transitions that the deaminase chemistry can effect, and the constrained editing window requires careful guide design to target the desired nucleotide(s) [6,5].\n\nPrime editing expands the repertoire of attainable edits by encoding the desired sequence change within a pegRNA and directing reverse transcription of that sequence at a nicked DNA strand using a Cas9 nickase–reverse transcriptase fusion [6]. This approach can install insertions, deletions, and all base substitutions while producing fewer bystander indels than DSB-dependent HDR, thereby reducing some complications associated with nuclease-created breaks and lowering dependence on cell-cycle–restricted HDR pathways [6].",
    "## Tool variants, engineering improvements, and multiplexing\n\nThe contemporary CRISPR toolkit has broadened to include engineered Cas9 variants that exhibit improved specificity and reduced off-target activity, alternative single-effector nucleases such as Cas12a and RNA-targeting nucleases such as Cas13 that differ in PAM requirements and cleavage patterns, and specialized modalities for transcriptional modulation (CRISPRa/CRISPRi) that decouple nuclease activity from gene regulation [2,6]. These complementary tool classes expand the editable sequence space and provide distinct mechanistic options for DNA or RNA targeting, enabling selection of effectors that better match particular experimental or therapeutic goals [2,6].\n\nMultiplex editing is rendered more tractable by designs that place multiple guide RNAs into a single delivery construct, allowing concurrent modification of several loci. Single-effector systems that process guide arrays, notably Cas12a, simplify multiplex architectures because the nuclease itself can process multiple CRISPR RNAs from a compact transcript, and because guide programming relies on RNA design rather than the more complex protein engineering required for zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) [2,1]. These engineering improvements and modular guide-design paradigms have motivated algorithmic and nuclease-level approaches to restrict off-target cleavage, alter PAM specificity, and define programmable activity windows, all with the aim of improving precision and therapeutic safety [1,2].\n\n### Engineering for specificity\n\nA principal avenue for improving editing specificity has been engineering nuclease variants, such as high-fidelity Cas9 proteins that carry defined point mutations and mutants with altered PAM recognition, which reduce promiscuous DNA binding and undesired double-strand breaks (DSBs); nevertheless, guide RNA sequence selection remains a primary determinant of specificity in practice [1]. These engineered protein variants alter interactions that underlie target recognition and cleavage, thereby lowering the incidence of off-target events while preserving on-target activity when paired with appropriate guides [1].\n\nTo support guide selection and empirical validation, computational prediction tools are routinely combined with orthogonal empirical off-target profiling assays. Genome-wide empirical methods such as GUIDE-seq and related assays are applied to candidate guides to detect unintended cleavage sites prior to therapeutic or sensitive experimental applications, providing an empirical safeguard that complements in silico predictions [1,4,6]. This two-pronged strategy—algorithmic ranking followed by empirical confirmation—helps to prioritize guides with favorable specificity profiles and to document residual off-target activity for risk assessment [1,4,6].\n\n### Multiplexing strategies\n\nMultiplexing strategies rely on co-expressing multiple guide RNAs so that several genomic loci can be edited concurrently, enabling coordinated genetic perturbations within a single cell or organism. Cas12a-type nucleases facilitate this approach through their intrinsic ability to process arrays of CRISPR RNAs into individual guides from a compact transcript, which simplifies construct design and payload requirements relative to systems that require separate guide expression cassettes or extensive protein engineering [2]. The reliance on RNA-program design for multiplexing contrasts with the more labor-intensive protein design needed for multi-target ZFNs or TALENs, streamlining experimental workflows and vector design [2,1].\n\nFunctionally, multiplex designs permit combinatorial perturbations that are especially valuable in high-throughput functional genomics screens, where simultaneous targeting of multiple genes or regulatory elements can reveal genetic interactions and pathway relationships. Beyond screening, multiplex editing is applied to the engineering of complex traits in agriculture and synthetic biology, where coordinated edits across several loci are often required to produce desired phenotypes or circuit behaviors [2,4]. These applications exploit both the practical advantages of compact guide architectures and the conceptual power of combinatorial perturbation enabled by multiplex CRISPR strategies [2,4].",
    "## Applications: research, diagnostics, agriculture and therapeutics\n\nCRISPR technologies have accelerated functional genomics by enabling the systematic construction and screening of gene knockout and knock‑in libraries, permitting more rapid mapping of gene function and genetic interactions across diverse organisms [1,4]. Such library-based screening approaches facilitate high-throughput identification of gene–phenotype relationships and interaction networks, reducing the time from hypothesis generation to functional insight and supporting large‑scale, data‑driven characterization of genetic function [1,4].\n\nRNA-targeting CRISPR systems have been adapted into sensitive diagnostic platforms that transduce sequence recognition into amplified readouts. In particular, Cas13’s activation-triggered collateral RNase activity is harnessed to cleave labeled reporters in SHERLOCK‑style assays, producing high‑sensitivity detection of target RNA sequences [4]. This collateral cleavage provides intrinsic signal amplification that can reduce assay complexity and has been explored for rapid and potentially point‑of‑care diagnostic formats [4].\n\nIn agriculture, CRISPR-mediated editing has been applied to targeted modification of traits in plants and animals, including growth and metabolic traits relevant to productivity and resilience [1]. The deployment of these capabilities is strongly shaped by regulatory interpretations and public acceptance; for example, European regulatory decisions such as the ECJ ruling that treats certain plant gene editing outcomes as genetically modified organisms influence the legal and commercial feasibility of edited crops and livestock and thereby affect adoption pathways [1].\n\nTherapeutic applications encompass both ex vivo and in vivo editing strategies and have progressed into clinical development for several indications. Ex vivo editing of hematopoietic stem cells and in vivo delivery approaches are being evaluated in early‑phase trials for inherited blood disorders and ocular diseases, among others [1,3]. Regulatory milestones for CRISPR‑based therapeutics, including approvals of exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy) in jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Bahrain and a U.S. regulatory action in December 2023, illustrate the clinical translation of genome‑editing technologies for sickle‑cell disease and beta‑thalassemia [1].\n\n### Clinical translation and examples\n\nClinical translation of CRISPR‑based approaches is commonly categorized into ex vivo and in vivo strategies. Ex vivo methods edit cells outside the body followed by reinfusion, whereas in vivo approaches deliver editing reagents directly to target tissues; early‑phase clinical studies of both modalities have reported safety signals and indications of therapeutic benefit in settings such as inherited blood disorders and ocular diseases [1,3]. These modalities differ in delivery requirements, safety considerations, and regulatory pathways, which jointly shape development strategies and clinical trial design [1,3].\n\nIndustry examples illustrate the pathway from academic discovery to clinical programs. Editas Medicine, a company co‑founded by academic CRISPR pioneers, has advanced clinical‑stage programs spanning in vivo ocular editing and ex vivo hematopoietic approaches, including programs such as EDIT‑101 for Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10) and EDIT‑301 for sickle cell disease and beta‑thalassemia using Cas12a‑based editing [3]. Such programs exemplify how variations in nuclease choice and delivery strategy are being evaluated clinically to address both localized monogenic disorders and systemic hematologic diseases [3].\n\n### Diagnostics and non-permanent editing\n\nCas13‑based diagnostic platforms exploit the enzyme’s collateral cleavage activity to convert target RNA recognition into detectable reporter cleavage, forming the basis of sensitive assays such as SHERLOCK‑style diagnostics [4]. By coupling specific target recognition to nonspecific RNase‑mediated reporter degradation, these assays achieve signal amplification that supports low‑copy detection of RNA targets and has motivated exploration of formats intended for rapid or point‑of‑care use [4].\n\nRNA‑targeting and RNA‑editing approaches, including adenosine‑to‑inosine and cytosine‑to‑uracil conversions, enable reversible modulation of transcript sequence and gene expression without introducing permanent genomic changes, thereby reducing long‑term genomic risk relative to DNA editing [4,5]. These non‑permanent modalities are applicable to transient therapeutic goals—such as modulation of splicing or expression—and to antiviral strategies or other contexts where temporally limited intervention is desirable [5,4].",
    "## Safety, off-target effects, ethical and regulatory landscape\n\nMajor safety concerns associated with CRISPR-based genome editing include unintended off-target edits such as unplanned double-strand breaks or base changes, large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, immune responses directed against CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, and the uncertain long-term consequences of heritable germline modifications [1,5]. These biological risks are central to contemporary scientific assessment of genome-editing technologies because they can produce genomic instability, unanticipated phenotypes, or adverse clinical outcomes that may only become apparent over extended follow-up intervals [1,5]. The cumulative uncertainty about both immediate and long-term harms has therefore become a primary factor shaping regulatory scrutiny and ethical debate surrounding applications of these technologies [1,5].\n\nRegulatory responses have varied by jurisdiction and application, reflecting different legal frameworks and policy priorities. In the agricultural domain, the European Union has treated many CRISPR-edited plants under existing GMO rules following court interpretation, thereby subjecting such products to the regulatory pathway used for genetically modified organisms [1]. In the therapeutic domain, clinical development and market authorization generally proceed through drug and biologic regulatory pathways, and early therapeutic approvals represent important regulatory milestones that influence subsequent oversight and expectations for safety and efficacy evidence [1]. These divergent regulatory trajectories—stricter oversight in some jurisdictions for plant applications and established pharmaceutical pathways for medical uses—have practical implications for research planning, commercialization timelines, and the nature of evidence required by regulators [1].\n\nIntellectual property and commercialization dynamics further interact with safety and regulatory landscapes to shape the pace and direction of development. High-profile patent disputes have affected who can license foundational CRISPR reagents and how commercial entities structure access to enabling technologies, and adjudication by patent offices and courts has produced a sequence of rulings with evolving outcomes that continue to influence market entry and collaboration strategies [1]. Together, safety concerns, ethical debates, regulatory diversity, and contested patent landscapes form an interdependent environment that conditions both the research trajectory and the public deployment of CRISPR-based applications [1,5].\n\n### Ethical issues and germline editing\n\nHuman germline editing is widely regarded as ethically contentious because changes to the germline are heritable and thus propagate to future generations, raising questions about consent, intergenerational risk, and social consequences; as a result, most scientific and regulatory bodies have called for moratoria or stringent oversight until safety, efficacy, and broader social implications are adequately addressed [1,5]. The combination of uncertain long-term biological effects and profound ethical considerations underpins calls for careful deliberation and restrictive policy measures prior to any clinical use of germline modification [1,5].\n\nBy contrast, somatic genome editing, which does not alter germline cells and therefore is non-heritable, encounters fewer ethical barriers in principle but still requires rigorous safeguards. Somatic applications demand robust demonstration of safety and efficacy, clear and informed consent processes for participants, attention to equitable access to resulting therapies, and commitments to long-term follow-up to monitor delayed or rare adverse outcomes [1]. These requirements reflect an ethical framework that balances potential patient benefit against risks and societal considerations while distinguishing somatic clinical use from germline interventions [1].\n\n### Patent, commercialization and policy impacts\n\nEarly and ongoing patent disputes have materially influenced commercialization strategies in the CRISPR field by determining who may license key reagents and by prompting a proliferation of licensing arrangements and industry entrants operating under varied terms; these patent decision processes continue to shape competitive dynamics and strategic choices for developers of both research tools and therapeutics [1]. Decisions by patent offices and courts in different jurisdictions have produced a complex and evolving intellectual property landscape that affects research freedom, collaboration models, and the cost and availability of enabling technologies [1].\n\nPublic policy and regulatory decisions further determine the practical timelines and incentives for deploying CRISPR-derived products. Regulatory frameworks such as GMO rules for edited plants and clinical trial and approval processes for therapeutics channel development efforts and set evidentiary standards, while landmark approvals in the therapeutic arena serve as important milestones that can accelerate subsequent investment and regulatory expectations [1]. Consequently, policy actions both constrain and incentivize the generation of safety and efficacy evidence required for responsible deployment of genome-editing applications [1].",
    "## Computation, predictive models and automated design\n\nAccurate guide design and off-target prediction are central to safe and effective genome and transcriptome editing, and recent computational advances aim to improve both aspects. Machine learning and deep learning models that integrate sequence, structural, and evolutionary features have been shown to improve predictions of on-target efficiency and off-target propensity, providing more reliable guidance for experimental design and risk assessment [4,6]. These predictive models and automated design agents together form complementary computational strategies: the former enhances the quantitative assessment of candidate guides, while the latter operationalizes design choices and experimental workflows for users [4,6].\n\nOne representative deep learning approach, DeepFM-Crispr (also described as DeepFM-Cas13d for RNA-targeting contexts), exemplifies how multi-component neural architectures can capture complex determinants of guide efficacy by fusing sequence and structural information. DeepFM-Crispr combines pretrained RNA language model embeddings correlated with secondary structure, explicit secondary-pairing prediction modules, and integrated feature encoders to produce efficacy scores that outperform prior baselines on benchmark Cas13d screening datasets [4]. The demonstrated improvements emphasize the value of incorporating RNA-specific features and pretrained representations when predicting guides for RNA-targeting CRISPR systems [4].\n\nComplementing model-centric efforts, tool-augmented large language model (LLM) agents automate multi-step experimental planning and lower the barrier for non-experts to design and iterate CRISPR experiments. Systems such as CRISPR-GPT augment an LLM with curated domain knowledge and integrated computational tools to perform tasks including system selection, gRNA design, delivery choice, protocol drafting, off-target analysis, and validation planning while surfacing ethical and regulatory constraints for users [6]. While these agents can accelerate iterative design and provide structured recommendations, they also necessitate careful grounding with authoritative tools and safeguards to mitigate risks such as hallucination or misuse [6].\n\n### Deep learning for guide efficacy (DeepFM-Crispr)\n\nDeepFM-Crispr encodes single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) initially via one-hot sequence encoding and then leverages an RNA-FM transformer-based large language model to generate contextual embeddings that correlate with RNA secondary structure [4]. The architecture then predicts secondary pairing through a ResNet-based module and integrates the sequence and structure-derived features using DenseNet-like feature integration together with transformer encoder layers, culminating in a multilayer perceptron that outputs predicted efficacy scores [4]. This multi-component pipeline explicitly models RNA structural constraints alongside sequence context to better capture determinants of Cas13d guide performance [4].\n\nValidation on Cas13d screening datasets demonstrated that DeepFM-Crispr improves predictive accuracy relative to prior baselines, supporting the conclusion that pretrained RNA language models and explicit structural embeddings materially enhance RNA-targeting guide efficacy prediction. The key modeling insight is that inclusion of structural embeddings derived from RNA secondary structure predictors, coupled with pretrained RNA language models, addresses unique constraints of Cas13 systems and yields more reliable efficacy estimates for sgRNA selection [4].\n\n### LLM agents for experimental planning (CRISPR-GPT)\n\nCRISPR-GPT augments a large language model with curated CRISPR domain knowledge and integrated computational toolkits—such as guide design tools, off-target predictors, and protocol templates—to automate multi-step experiment design and iterative refinement. The agent implements state-machine workflows and chain-of-thought-style iteration to handle tasks that span system selection, gRNA design, delivery method recommendation, protocol drafting, off-target analysis, primer design, and validation planning [6]. By combining generative reasoning with deterministic tool calls, CRISPR-GPT illustrates how tool-augmented LLMs can lower the barrier for non-experts and accelerate iterative experimental design [6].\n\nThe design and deployment of such LLM agents also highlight important challenges and mitigations: the risk of LLM hallucinations when producing precise sequences necessitates integration with authoritative sequence alignment and off-target validation tools (for example, BLAST-style aligners and specialized off-target predictors), and ethical safeguards are required to prevent misuse or unsafe recommendations [6]. Grounding LLM outputs in validated computational tools and curated domain knowledge is therefore essential to preserve accuracy and safety while retaining the efficiency gains of automated experimental planning [6].",
    "## Delivery strategies and translational challenges\n\nThe choice of delivery modality — including viral vectors (such as AAV and lentivirus), lipid nanoparticles, electroporation, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery and other formats — critically determines editing efficiency, cell‑type specificity, immunogenicity and the downstream regulatory pathway for a given program [1,3,5]. Each modality imposes distinct constraints on biodistribution and cellular uptake that in turn shape both preclinical development and clinical translation, necessitating early alignment of delivery strategy with the intended therapeutic indication and target cell population [1,3,5]. \n\nIn vivo delivery approaches require particularly stringent safety profiling and the development of tissue‑targeting strategies to manage biodistribution and systemic immune responses, because reagents are administered directly to the patient and encounter complex physiological barriers [1,3,5]. By contrast, ex vivo editing workflows permit the physical selection, expansion and detailed characterization of edited cells prior to reinfusion, enabling quality control of the therapeutic cell product but adding requirements for cell harvest, manufacturing capacity and transplantation infrastructure [1,3,5]. \n\nTranslation to the clinic is constrained by several bottlenecks that are evident in early trial reports and industry pipelines. Programs must attain sufficient on‑target editing within therapeutically relevant cell populations while minimizing off‑target alterations and immune reactions; they must also establish scalable, GMP‑compliant production of nucleases, guide RNAs and delivery vehicles; and they must plan for long‑term safety and efficacy monitoring in treated patients [1,3]. Initial first‑in‑human and early intravenous or intravitreal studies have shown promising safety signals, and the regulatory approval of a CRISPR‑based product for hemoglobinopathies demonstrates feasibility; however, approved therapies have also highlighted challenges of high cost, complex manufacturing and constrained patient selection that limit broad access and underscore the need for further translational work [1].\n\n### In vivo vs ex vivo tradeoffs\n\nEx vivo editing strategies, exemplified by hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) editing for hemoglobinopathies, provide the ability to select, expand and comprehensively characterize edited cells prior to patient infusion, which can reduce uncertainty about product composition and safety; however, these approaches require clinical infrastructure for cell harvest, ex vivo manipulation and reinfusion [1,3,5]. The ex vivo route therefore shifts complexity into cell processing and transplantation workflows, with implications for scalability and center requirements even as it affords tighter control over the final therapeutic product [1,3,5].\n\nIn vivo editing can directly target affected tissues — for example, ocular or hepatic targets — and thereby avoid the need for transplantation steps, but it faces distinct delivery, biodistribution and systemic immune hurdles that complicate dosing and safety assessment [1,3,5]. Clinical programs illustrate these modality choices: ocular in vivo programs (for example intravitreal delivery trials) address localized targets using viral delivery, while ex vivo hematopoietic programs manipulate HSCs ex vivo to achieve systemic benefit, demonstrating how indication and target biology drive the selection between in vivo and ex vivo strategies [3].\n\n### Manufacturing, regulation and clinical evidence needs\n\nLate‑stage clinical development and broad approval require scalable GMP manufacturing of all therapeutic components — including nucleases, guide RNAs, viral vectors or lipid nanoparticles — together with robust quality‑control assays and release criteria to ensure consistent product identity, potency and safety [1,5]. Regulatory agencies assess a portfolio of evidence that typically includes measures of editing efficiency in the intended cell populations, comprehensive off‑target profiling, evaluation of insertional mutagenesis risk for integrating vectors and detailed plans for long‑term follow‑up to capture delayed adverse events or durability outcomes [1,5].\n\nThe first regulatory approvals of CRISPR‑based therapies represent important milestones for the field but also reinforce the need for continued post‑approval surveillance and generation of real‑world evidence to inform long‑term safety, durability and cost‑effectiveness discussions [1]. Ongoing collection of clinical outcome data and registry‑style monitoring will be essential to refine risk–benefit assessments, guide patient selection, and support policy and reimbursement decisions as genome‑editing therapeutics move beyond early clinical programs [1]."
