Much research has focused on patterns of excessive use, often called \"digital addictions\" or \"digital dependencies,\" which can vary across different cultures and societies. At the same time, some experts have explored the positive effects of moderate digital media use, including its potential to support mental health and offer innovative treatments. For example, participation in online support communities has been found to provide mental health benefits, although the overall impact of digital media remains complex.\nThe difference between beneficial and pathological use of digital media has not been established. There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria associated with digital media overuse, although some experts consider overuse a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. The prevention and treatment of pathological digital media use are not standardized, although guidelines for safer media use for children and families have been developed. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, 2013) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) currently do not recognize problematic internet use or problematic social media use as official diagnoses. However, the ICD-11 does include gaming disorder—often referred to as video game addiction—while the DSM-5 does not. As of 2023, there remains ongoing debate about if and when these behaviors should be formally diagnosed. Additionally, the use of the term \"addiction\" to describe these conditions has been increasingly questioned.\nDigital media and screen time amongst modern social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Facebook have changed how children think, interact and develop in positive and negative ways, but researchers are unsure about the existence of hypothesized causal links between digital media use and mental health outcomes. Those links appear to depend on the individual and the platforms they use.\n\n\n== History and terminology ==\nThe relationship between digital technology and mental health has been studied from multiple perspectives.[1][2][3] Research has identified benefits of digital media use for childhood and adolescent development.[4][5] However, researchers, clinicians, and the public have also expressed concern over compulsive behaviors linked to digital media use, as increasing evidence shows correlations between excessive technology use and mental health issues.\nTerminologies used to refer to compulsive digital-media-use behaviours are not standardized or universally recognised. They include \"digital addiction\", \"digital dependence\", \"problematic use\", or \"overuse\", often delineated by the digital media platform used or under study (such as problematic smartphone use or problematic internet use). Unrestrained use of technological devices may affect developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and may result in symptoms akin to other psychological dependence syndromes, or behavioral addictions. The focus on problematic technology use in research, particularly in relation to the behavioural addiction paradigm, is becoming more accepted, despite poor standardization and conflicting research.\nInternet addiction has been proposed as a diagnosis since the 1998 and social media and its relation to addiction has been examined since 2009. A 2018 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report stated there were benefits of structured and limited internet use in children and adolescents for developmental and educational purposes, but that excessive use can have a negative impact on mental well-being. The report also noted a 40% overall increase in internet use among school-age children between 2010 and 2015, with significant variations in usage rates and platform preferences across different OECD countries.[1] The American Psychological Association recommends that adolescents receive training or coaching on social media use to help them develop psychologically informed skills and competencies, promoting balanced, safe, and meaningful engagement online.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has not formally classified problematic digital media use as a diagnostic category but identified internet gaming disorder as a condition warranting further study in 2013.[1] Meanwhile, gaming disorder—commonly known as video game addiction—is recognized in the ICD-11.[2][3] The differing recommendations between the DSM and ICD partly reflect a lack of expert consensus, variations in the focus of each classification system, and challenges in applying animal models to behavioral addictions.\nThe utility of the term addiction in relation to the overuse of digital media has been questioned, in regard to its suitability to describe new, digitally mediated psychiatric categories, as opposed to overuse being a manifestation of other psychiatric disorders. Usage of the term has also been criticised for drawing parallels with substance use behaviours. Careless use of the term may cause more problems—both downplaying the risks of harm in seriously affected people, as well as overstating risks of excessive, non-pathological use of digital media. The evolution of terminology relating excessive digital media use to problematic use rather than addiction was encouraged by Panova and Carbonell, psychologists at Ramon Llull University, in a 2018 review.\nDue to the lack of recognition and consensus on the concepts used, diagnoses and treatments are difficult to standardize or develop. Heightened levels of public anxiety around new media (including social media, smartphones and video games) adds confusion to the interpretation of population-based assessments, as well as posing management dilemmas. Radesky and Christakis, the 2019 editors of JAMA Paediatrics, published a review that investigated \"concerns about health and developmental/behavioral risks of excessive media use for child cognitive, language, literacy, and social-emotional development.\" Due to the ready availability of multiple technologies to children worldwide, the problem is bi-directional, as taking away digital devices may have a detrimental effect, in areas such as learning, family relationship dynamics, and overall development.\n\n\n== Problematic use ==\n\nThough associations have been observed between digital media use and mental health symptoms or diagnoses, causality has not been established; nuances and caveats published by researchers are often misunderstood by the general public, or misrepresented by the media. Problematic social media use can also result in fear of missing out (FoMO) in which symptoms of anxiety and psychological stress exasperated with the fear of potentially missing content present online leaving the individual feeling unfulfilled or left out of the loop. Worsening mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, have been linked to digital use—particularly among younger users who may be more vulnerable to social comparison. Neuroscientific findings that support a structural change in the brain, similar to behavioural addictions; have not found a specific biological or neural processes that may lead to excessive digital media use.\nWhen an individual has FoMo they will be more likely to constantly check their social media accounts using their personal devices to check social media or messages to ensure they are up to date with information that is occurring within the individual's social network. This constant need to check social media platforms for information induces feelings of anxiety driving individuals to get involved with problematic social media use. \n\n\n=== Screen time and mental health ===\n\nCertain types of problematic internet use have been linked to psychiatric and behavioral issues such as depression, anxiety, hostility, aggression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, studies have not established clear causal relationships—for instance, it remains unclear whether individuals with depression overuse the internet because of their condition, or if excessive internet use contributes to developing depression.[1] Research also suggests that social media’s effects can be both positive and negative, depending on individual circumstances.[2] While digital media overuse has been associated with depressive symptoms, it may also be used in some cases to improve mood.[3][4] A large prospective study found a positive correlation between ADHD symptoms and digital media use.[5] Although the ADHD symptom of hyperfocus may lead some individuals to spend excessive time on video games, social media, or online chatting, the link between hyperfocus and problematic social media use is relatively weak.[6]A 2018 review found associations between the self-reported mental health symptoms by users of the Chinese social media platform WeChat and excessive platform use. However, the motivations and usage patterns of WeChat users affected overall psychological health, rather than the amount of time spent using the platform.\nThe evidence, although of mainly low to moderate quality, shows a correlation between heavy screen time and a variety of physical and mental health problems. However, moderate use of digital media has been linked to positive outcomes, including improved social integration, mental health, and overall well-being for young people. In fact, certain digital platforms, when used in moderation, have even been associated with enhanced mental health.\n\nIn a 2022 review, it was discovered that when it comes to adolescents' well-being that perhaps there is too much focus on locating a negative correlation between digital technologies and adolescents' well-being, If a negative correlation between the two are located the impact would potentially be minimal to the point where it would have little to no impact on adolescent well-being or quality of life.\n\n\n=== Social media and mental health ===\nExcessive time spent on social media may be more harmful than digital screen time as a whole, especially for young people. Some research has found a \"substantial\" association between social media use and mental health issues, but most studies have found only a weak or inconsistent relationship.  Social media can have both positive and negative effects on mental health; whether the overall effect is harmful or helpful may depend on a variety of factors, including the quality and quantity of social media usage. In the case of those over 65, studies have found high levels of social media usage was associated with positive outcomes overall, such as flourishing, though it remains unclear if social media use is a causative factor.\nSocial media can be a valuable tool that, when used appropriately, brings positive benefits both online and offline. For adolescents, social media offers opportunities to build and maintain relationships, access information, connect with others in real time, and express themselves through creating and engaging with content.[1][2] However, improper use of social media can pose risks. Adolescents may be exposed to cyberbullying, sexual predators, inappropriate adult content, substance use, and unrealistic portrayals of people and lifestyles.[1][2]\nDigital technologies tend to focus more on hedonic well-being, in which users are exposed to content that evokes joy and laughter towards positive content, to anger and sadness towards negative content. In turn these negative impacts on adolescence or any users of social media will only experience temporary impacts on mental well-being, which will not have a permanent effect on the user's quality of life and life satisfaction.\nWhen asked about the amount of time spent on social media teenagers reported that 55 percent have the right\n\n---\n\nIndex: 2\nTitle: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_health_concerns_about_Donald_Trump\nContent: At 79 years old, Donald Trump, the 47th and previously 45th president of the United States, is the oldest person in American history to be inaugurated as president for the second time. He became the oldest presidential nominee of a major party in July 2024, five weeks after his 78th birthday. Should he serve as president until August 15, 2028, he would be the oldest sitting president in American history. On January 20, 2029, the end of his second term, he would be 82 years, seven months, and six days old. \nSince the early days of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, his physical and mental health have been debated. Trump was 70 years old when he first took office, surpassing Ronald Reagan as the oldest person to assume the presidency. Trump's age, weight, lifestyle, and history of heart disease raised questions about his physical health. Some psychiatrists and reporters have speculated that Trump may have mental health impairments, such as dementia (which runs in his family) or narcissistic personality disorder. Such claims have prompted discussion about ethics and applicability of the Goldwater rule, which prohibits mental health professionals from publicly diagnosing or discussing the diagnosis of public figures without their consent and direct examination. Public opinion polling from July 2024 indicated an increase in the percentage of Americans concerned about his fitness for a second term. \nDuring the 2024 election campaign, some critics raised concerns regarding former president Trump's transparency about his medical records and overall health, noting that he had not publicly released a full medical report since 2015. Critics noted that his opponent, Kamala Harris, had released her records, and that such disclosures are a common practice among presidential candidates. On April 13, 2025, three months after Trump's second inauguration, the White House released the results of his physical examination and his cognitive assessment; it concluded that Trump was in \"excellent health\" and \"fully fit\" to serve as commander-in-chief.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCoverage of Trump's mental acuity has generated discussion of whether the media has been \"sanewashing\" Trump by selecting more coherent clips or quotes from his speeches that give a false impression of mental acuity without balancing that coverage by also focusing on the parts of his speeches that might raise concerns about his mental fitness to be President.\nAs of 2018, Trump does not drink alcohol; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981. He also said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.\n\n\n== 2016 presidential campaign (2015–2016) ==\nIn December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a letter praising Trump for \"extraordinary physical strength and stamina\". The letter asserted that Trump would be \"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\" and said that a recent medical exam yielded \"only positive results\". Before Bornstein's death in 2021, he told CNN that Trump had dictated the entire letter. The language used was in Trump's style and not that typical of a medical doctor; in particular, the American journalist Kurt Eichenwald noted that positive test results often do not mean a positive (favorable) outcome for the patient. A follow-up medical report by Bornstein claimed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin. At 6 feet 3 inches (1.90 m) and 236 pounds (107 kg), Trump's body mass index of 29.5 registered as overweight which is on the higher end of overweight BMIs.\nDuring the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, presidential candidate and primary opponent Jeb Bush speculated in February 2016 that Trump had mental health issues, stating, \"I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the guy needs therapy.\"\n\n\n== First presidency and 2020 presidential campaign (2017–2020) ==\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThe \"Duty to Warn\" movement was founded by medical professionals concerned about Trump's cognitive health in his first year in office. \nIn 2016 and 2017, a number of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists faced criticism for violating the Goldwater rule; despite having never examined him, they claimed that Donald Trump displayed \"an assortment of personality problems, including grandiosity, a lack of empathy, and 'malignant narcissism'\", and that he had a \"dangerous mental illness\".\nIn 2017, psychologist John Gartner collected more than 41,000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The petition asserted that Trump suffered from a serious mental illness and was \"psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties\" of the presidency. Gartner asserted that Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of narcissism, paranoia, sociopathy, and sadism.\nIn February 2017, psychiatrist Allen Frances wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times regarding Trump and narcissistic personality disorder. Frances said, \"I wrote the criteria that define this disorder, and Mr. Trump doesn't meet them.\" According to the American Psychiatric Association, \"saying that a person does not have an illness is also a professional opinion.\"\nOn April 14, 2017, Representatives Jamie Raskin and Earl Blumenauer introduced the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. The bill, if passed, would have allowed Congress, by a concurrent resolution, to require an 11-member commission to conduct an examination of the president and report the findings.\nIn April 2017, forensic psychiatrist Bandy X. Lee hosted a meeting at Yale University medical school regarding the ethics of discussing Trump's mental health. In October 2017, Lee published The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, containing essays from 27 psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health professionals on the \"clear and present danger\" that Trump's mental health poses to the \"nation and individual well being\". They argued that the president's issues affected the mental health of the United States population, and that he placed the country at grave risk of war because of his pathological traits. They asserted that Trump exhibited narcissistic personality disorder, 'extreme present hedonism' and bullying. Carlos Lozada, writing for The Washington Post, considered these conclusions \"compelling\", but also noted that the book contributors were writing from their own political perspectives and that other mental health professionals held differing views. Lee and others contended that Trump's presidency represented an emergency allowing, or even requiring, psychiatrists to make an exception to the APA's Goldwater rule, which holds that it is unethical for members of the APA to give professional opinions about public figures without having examined them in person and without having obtained their consent. Proponents of such an exception have asserted that there is precedent in allowing psychiatrists to speak out when someone presents a clear and present danger.\nIn September 2017, Jeanne Suk Gerson wrote in The New Yorker, \"A strange consensus does appear to be forming around Trump's mental state\", including Democrats and Republicans who doubt Trump's fitness for office.\nAlso in September 2017, journalist Bill Moyers interviewed psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton and said that Trump \"makes increasingly bizarre statements that are contradicted by irrefutable evidence to the contrary\". Lifton replied, \"He doesn't have clear contact with reality, though I'm not sure it qualifies as a bona fide delusion.\" As an example, Lifton said, when Trump claimed that former president Barack Obama was born in Kenya, \"he was manipulating that lie as well as undoubtedly believing it in part.\"\nIn September 2017, psychiatrist Jeffrey A. Lieberman published an article commenting on Donald Trump's mental health. He pointed out that as per Goldwater rule, no diagnosis should be made of public figures, but also stated that assessing the president's fitness to government should not be left to politicians alone. He arrived at a diagnosis of \"incipient dementia\" but faced no sanctions.\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nIn 2018, Trump dismissed then-prevalent questions regarding his mental health, stating that he is a \"very stable genius\". As evidence of his mental capacities, he pointed to his business success, his victory over Republican competitors, and his election to the presidency against Hillary Clinton. Trump has also pushed back on claims he couldn't remember the name of a fallen soldier while talking to the widow by stating he has \"one of the great memories of all time\".\nIn January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended, and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues. Several independent cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle and LDL cholesterol ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health. Trump's 2018 coronary CT calcium scan score indicates he has a form of heart disease called coronary artery disease, which is common for white males at his age.\n\nIn January 2018, after North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and Trump publicly exchanged claims about their respective \"nuclear buttons\", Richard Painter, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, deemed Trump \"psychologically unfit\" and supported transferring his powers to Vice President Mike Pence under the 25th Amendment. In April 2018, Vanity Fair reported that Trump's advisers \"worry about his mental health\" when he is outside the controls available in the White House environment.\nIn response to speculation about his cognitive abilities, Trump voluntarily took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of his January 2018 health checkup. He reported receiving a score of 30/30, indicating a normal level of cognitive function, although the results have not been released. Critics have contended that the MoCA test is too basic to diagnose the problems asserted. Trump used the phrase \"Person, woman, man, camera, TV\" several times during a July 2020 Fox News interview with Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at New York University, while describing part of the 2018 MoCA test and praising his own performance on it. Trump has not publicly revealed the results of any subsequent cognitive tests but, as late as 2024, continued to praise his performance in the 2018 cognitive test. Ziad Nasreddine, the neurologist who created the test, noted that 2018 results would be too outdated to be relevant in 2024.\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\nAn academic consensus across multiple studies was made in 2019, characterizing Trump as having \"very high extraversion, very low agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and sky-high narcissism\".\nIn 2019, amid continued speculation, the American Psychiatric Association and Alzheimer's Society requested that professionals other than Trump's doctors adhere to the Goldwater Rule and refrain from giving armchair diagnoses of Trump. A growing number of individuals in academia have continued to call for a relaxation of the Goldwater rule.\nIn February 2019, Trump was examined by White House physician Sean Conley. Conley stated Trump was in \"very good health overall\", although Trump was now slightly clinically obese, at 243 pounds (110 kg) with a BMI of 30.4. \nIn a July 4, 2019, speech, Trump said that during the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army \"took over the airports\" from the British (airplanes were not invented until 1903).\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nClinical psychologist Mary L. Trump, who is Trump's niece, published a book in 2020 identifying the disorders she believed him to have.\nTrump appeared unsteady while walking down a ramp at the United States Air Force Academy on June 15, 20\n\n---\n\nIndex: 3\nTitle: Mental health in education\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_in_education\nContent: Mental health in education is the impact that mental health (including emotional, psychological, and social well-being) has on educational performance. Mental health often viewed as an adult issue, but in fact, almost half of adolescents in the United States are affected by mental disorders, and about 20% of these are categorized as “severe.” Mental health issues can pose a huge problem for students in terms of academic and social success in school. Education systems around the world treat this topic differently, both directly through official policies and indirectly through cultural views on mental health and well-being. These curriculums are in place to effectively identify mental health disorders and treat it using therapy, medication, or other tools of alleviation. Students' mental health and well-being is very much supported by schools. Schools try to promote mental health awareness and resources. Schools can help these students with interventions, support groups, and therapies. These resources can help reduce the negative impact on mental health. Schools can create mandatory classes based on mental health that can help them see signs of mental health disorders. \n\n\n== Prevalence of mental health issues in adolescents ==\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 46% of American adolescents aged 13–18 will suffer from some form of mental disorder. About 21% will suffer from a disorder that is categorized as “severe,” meaning that the disorder impairs their daily functioning, but almost two-thirds of these adolescents will not receive formal mental health support. The most common types of disorders among adolescents as reported by the NIMH is anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and others), with a lifetime prevalence of about 25% in youth aged 13–18 and 6% of those cases being categorized as severe. Next is mood disorders (major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and/or bipolar disorder), with a lifetime prevalence of 14% and 4.7% for severe cases in adolescents. A similarly common disorder is Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is categorized as a childhood disorder but oftentimes carries through into adolescence and adulthood. The prevalence for ADHD in American adolescents is 9%, and 1.8% for severe cases. It is important to understand that ADHD is a serious issue in not only children but adults. When children have ADHD a number of mental illnesses can come from that which can affect their education and hold them back from succeeding.\nAccording to Mental Health America, more than 10% of young people exhibit symptoms of depression strong enough to severely undermine their ability to function at school, at home, or whilst managing relationships.\nA 2021 study conducted by NIMH managed to link 31.4% of suicide deaths to a mental health disorder, the most common ones being attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression. Suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 10–29 years in the United States during 2011–2019. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. There are an average of over 3,470 attempts by students in grades 9–12.\nAccording to APA, the percentage of students going for college mental health counselling has been rising in recent years with anxiety as the most common factor, depression as the second, stress as the third, family issues as the fourth, and academic performance and relationship problems as the fifth and sixth respectively.\n\n\n== Common disorders effects on academics and school life ==\nMental disorders can affect classroom learning, such as poor attendance, difficulties with academic performance, poor social integration, trouble adjusting to school, problems with behavior regulation, and attention and concentration issues, all of which is critical to the overall success of the student. Not only do mental health disorders effect the individuals life but also the competitive job market. Students who are unable to perform in school, will be less likely to be able to perform in the workforce. High school students who screen positive for psychosocial dysfunction report three times as many absent and tardy days as students who do not identify dysfunction. This leads to much higher dropout rates and lower overall academic achievement. In the United States, only 40 percent of students with emotional, behavioral and mental health disorders graduate from high school, compared to the national average of 76 percent. An analysis of 40,350 undergraduates from 70 institutions by Posselt and Lipson found that they had a 37% higher chance of developing depression and a 69% higher chance of developing anxiety if they perceived their classroom environments as highly competitive.\n\n\n=== Anxiety ===\nStudents with anxiety disorders are statistically less likely to attend college than those without it, and those with social phobias are twice as likely to fail a grade or not finish high school as compared to students without the condition. Anxiety disorders are typically more difficult to recognize than disruptive behavior disorders, such as ADHD, because the symptoms are internalized. Anxiety may manifest as recurring fears and worries about routine parts of everyday life, avoiding activities, school or social interactions and it can interfere with the ability to focus and learn.\nThere is a specific character that people with anxiety often exhibit. People with anxiety experience frequent worries and fears about everyday situations. Anxiety can also be identified as a sudden feeling of intense fear or terror that can reach a peak within minutes. These anxiety symptoms usually develop during childhood or teen years and may continue into adulthood. Some examples of symptoms include: feeling nervous, restless or tense, having a sense of impending danger, panic, or doom, having an increased heart rate, breathing rapidly, sweating, trembling, feeling weak or tired, trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry, having trouble sleeping, experiencing gastrointestinal problems, having difficulty controlling worry, or having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety.\nThere are multiple types of anxieties that each present with unique symptoms. The most common type of anxiety is Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which presents with persistent and excessive worry that interferes with daily activities, feeling on edge/fatigued, worries about everyday things, and can cause physical symptoms, such as restlessness. Panic disorders, characterized by recurrent panic attacks which consist of palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, and a fear of dying, can cause physical and psychological distress. People with phobias experience excessive and persistent fear of objects or situations that are generally not harmful. Fear is excessive, which patients are aware of. Examples of phobias can include public speaking, spiders, or flying. Social anxiety disorder is a condition where people have significant anxiety about being embarrassed, so they will avoid situations that could cause embarrassment. An example of a situation that would be avoided would be eating or drinking in public. Finally, separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear or anxiety about separation which can cause functioning problems. People may be worried about leaving others and may have attachment issues.\nTreatments for anxiety can include medications, such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), and beta blockers. These medications function to relieve short-term anxiety, but are not meant to be used as long-term solutions. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most efficient form of treatment and is used as a short-term treatment. This therapy focuses on teaching specific skills for coping in order to improve symptoms. This can include exposure therapy, which increases exposure to potential triggers and is used to treat phobias.\n\n\n=== Depression ===\nDepression can cause students to have problems in class, from completing their work, to even attending class at all. In 2020, approximately 13% of youth aged 12 to 17 years old have had one major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year, with an overwhelming 70% left untreated. According to the National Center for Mental Health Checkups at Columbia University, \"High depression scores have been associated with low academic achievement, high scholastic anxiety, increased school suspensions, and decreased ability or desire to complete homework, concentrate, and attend classes.\" Depression symptoms can make it challenging for students to keep up with course loads, or even find the energy to make it through the full school day.\nDepression can be defined as a multi-problematic medical illness that negatively affects how one feels, thinks, and acts. The symptoms of depression can cause disturbances with interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning. This can later lead onto having varieties of emotional and physical problems. This can also decrease the ability to function mentally and physically. Some examples of depression symptoms are feeling sad, loss of interest, changes in appetite, trouble sleeping, loss of energy, increase in purposeless physical activity, feeling worthless, difficulty in thinking, concentrating, or making decisions, and thoughts of death or suicide. These symptoms must last two weeks and also represent a change in functioning in order for a diagnosis of depression.\nTreatments for depression can include normothymic drugs, antidepressant drugs (which have significant side effects), solving unresolved conflicts, relaxation, light therapy, sleep deprivation therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. Depression treatments need to be aimed at long-term treatment because depression can reoccur if not completely treated. Medications are better short-term treatments, while cognitive behavioral therapy is typically used as a more long-term treatment.\nAdolescents and middle-aged single adults at risk for low self-esteem (Depression) can be predicted based on their level of education, fear of missing out, valuation of the modern materialistic value conception, life satisfaction, depression, and habitual social media distraction. \n\n\n=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===\nAttention disorders are the principal predictors of diminished academic achievement. Students with ADHD tend to have trouble mastering behaviors and practices demanded of them by the public education system in the United States, such as the ability to quietly sit still or to apply themselves to one focused task for extended durations. ADHD can mean that students have problems concentrating, filtering out distracting external stimuli, and seeing large tasks through to completion. These students can also struggle with time management and organization. Symptoms of ADHD can include inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and other internalizing symptoms, such as depression.\nADHD stands for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This is considered as one of the most common mental disorders for children, however it affects many adults as well. Some examples of symptoms are not paying attention to details and making careless mistakes, having problems of staying focused on activities, not being able to be seen as listening, having problems in organizing, avoiding tasks, and forgetting daily tasks. These symptoms can cause a disturbance in the education of the affected student as well as other students in the class.\nTreatments for ADHD can include behavioral therapy, medications (both stimulants and nonstimulants), education about ADHD, and train\n\n---\n",

Key empirical observations include consistent correlations between heavy or problematic social media use and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and ADHD, particularly among adolescents, while causality remains unestablished due to largely cross-sectional and self-report data.

    "conclusion": "Social media’s impact on mental health is complex and context-dependent: moderate, purposeful use can support connection and well-being while excessive or problematic engagement correlates with anxiety, depression, and attentional difficulties—especially among adolescents. Current evidence is predominantly correlational with methodological limitations, diagnostic definitions remain unsettled, and standardized treatments are lacking. Policy and clinical responses should prioritize improving research quality (longitudinal and mechanistic studies), developing validated diagnostic criteria, promoting media literacy and structured use for young people, and tailoring interventions to individual risk factors and usage patterns. Public discourse and media framing must be cautious about overgeneralization and respect professional ethical boundaries when discussing mental health of individuals."

    "## Scope, history, and terminology\n\nResearch on the relationships between digital media and mental health originated in the mid-1990s, with investigators in psychology, sociology, anthropology and medicine initiating inquiry as use of the web and text messaging became widespread [1]. This multidisciplinary engagement reflected the rapid penetration of new communication technologies into everyday life and the need to understand their psychosocial and clinical implications [1].  \n\nTerminology in this field remains unsettled, with a range of labels applied to harmful or excessive engagement with digital technologies. Terms used in the literature include \"digital addiction,\" \"digital dependence,\" \"problematic use,\" and \"overuse,\" and these labels are frequently qualified by the specific platform or device under study (for example, \"problematic smartphone use\") [1]. The absence of a single standardized vocabulary has contributed to variability in how studies define and measure the phenomena of interest, complicating synthesis across research traditions [1].  \n\nThere is ongoing debate about whether patterns of excessive digital media use constitute a discrete psychiatric disorder or are better understood as manifestations or correlates of other underlying psychiatric conditions; concomitantly, the application of the addiction label to non-substance behaviours has been increasingly questioned in scholarly discourse [1]. International organizations and professional bodies have acknowledged both potential developmental or psychosocial benefits of structured and limited internet use and the harms associated with excessive use, while also noting that public anxiety about new media technologies can influence interpretation of population-level findings and public health responses [1].\n\n### Evolution of terminology and public concern\n\nConceptualizations of problematic digital engagement began to emerge in the late 1990s, with early proposals introducing constructs such as \"internet addiction\"; concern specific to social media platforms became prominent after approximately 2009 as these services gained mass adoption and scholarly attention [1]. Over time, the literature has shifted away from automatically framing maladaptive digital behaviour as an addiction, with many researchers preferring the broader and less pathologizing construct of \"problematic use\" to avoid inappropriate analogies to substance-use disorders and to reduce the risk of overpathologizing normative behaviour [1].  \n\nPublic discourse and media coverage have played a significant role in amplifying concerns about new media, and this amplification can skew perceptions of the strength and consistency of the empirical evidence, complicating evaluation of risk and benefit at the population level [1].",
    "## Diagnostic classification and professional debate\n\nThere is no widely accepted diagnostic criterion for problematic social media or broader internet use, and major classificatory systems take differing approaches to related phenomena. This lack of consensus is reflected in contemporary diagnostic manuals, where divergent positions on internet-related disorders have emerged and continue to influence clinical and research agendas [1]. The absence of uniform criteria complicates efforts to delineate what constitutes pathological use versus a range of normative but potentially harmful behaviors online [1].\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), refrains from formally classifying problematic social media or general internet use as established diagnoses, while explicitly designating internet gaming disorder as a condition meriting further study rather than full recognition. This position signals caution within one major diagnostic framework about premature pathologization and about the need for additional empirical validation before formal inclusion [1]. In contrast, the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11) does recognize gaming disorder as an official diagnosis, illustrating a clear point of divergence between the two systems in how they treat gaming-related pathology [1].\n\nThese classification differences have practical consequences for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The lack of a single, authoritative definition undermines standardization of prevention strategies, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic protocols across settings, and can result in variability in which behaviors are labeled as disordered and how they are treated or studied [1]. The professional debate over classification therefore has downstream effects on clinical recognition, research priorities, and the design of public health interventions [1].\n\n### DSM vs ICD and implications\n\nThe DSM-5 adopts a cautious stance by not formally classifying problematic internet or social media use, while identifying internet gaming disorder specifically as a provisional condition that warrants further empirical investigation and possible future inclusion. This approach reflects a requirement for additional research to establish diagnostic validity before broader adoption within that manual [1]. Because the DSM-5 stops short of endorsing generalized internet or social media addictions, clinicians relying on this framework must navigate uncertainty when encountering presentations that resemble addictive patterns but do not meet an established DSM diagnosis [1].\n\nBy contrast, the ICD-11’s formal recognition of gaming disorder creates a point of clinical and research divergence between the two systems, with the ICD-11 enabling diagnosis and coding of gaming disorder in contexts that follow its criteria. This recognition channels clinical attention and research funding toward gaming-related problems in jurisdictions and institutions that adopt ICD-11, while potentially leaving other internet-related behaviors less systematically addressed [1]. The disparity between ICD-11 and DSM-5 therefore contributes to inconsistent recognition and variable emphasis across clinical practice and scholarship [1].\n\nBecause these classification systems do not converge on a single conceptualization, efforts to standardize prevention, diagnostic, and treatment protocols remain complicated. Without consensus, cross-study comparisons and the development of unified clinical guidelines are hindered, and stakeholders must contend with heterogeneous criteria and thresholds for intervention across settings [1].\n\n### Ethics of public diagnosis and media representation\n\nMental health professionals are constrained by ethical rules that limit public diagnosis of individuals without direct clinical assessment, a principle exemplified by the Goldwater rule which discourages psychiatrists from offering diagnostic opinions about public figures whom they have not personally examined. Such ethical limits are intended to protect professional integrity and the rights of individuals against speculative or unverified diagnoses in public discourse [2]. The ethical debate includes questions about whether and when exceptions might be appropriate, particularly when clinicians perceive a risk of imminent public harm or danger posed by an individual's behavior; such exceptions remain contested within the profession [2].\n\nMedia practices further complicate public perceptions of mental health by selectively presenting material that can shape judgments about an individual's mental fitness. The framing and selection of coherent or persuasive clips can influence audience interpretations of behavior and competence, demonstrating how media discourse interacts with—and can distort—public assessments of mental health [2, 1]. This interaction between professional ethical restraint and media representation underscores the need for careful communication: clinicians must balance public responsibility with ethical limits on remote diagnosis, while media actors bear responsibility for how editorial choices affect perceptions of mental illness [2, 1].",
    "## Patterns of use and problematic behaviors\n\nProblematic patterns of digital media engagement encompass behaviors such as compulsive checking, excessive time spent online, and phenomena commonly referred to as fear of missing out (FoMO), which together can create persistent and repetitive interaction with platforms [1]. Observational research has identified associations between heavy or problematic digital media use and a range of adverse psychological correlates, including depressive and anxiety symptoms, hostility and aggression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology; however, these associations have not established causal relationships, and the directionality of effects remains unresolved [1]. Evidence further indicates that why and how individuals use digital platforms — that is, their motivations and specific usage patterns — often predict psychological outcomes more strongly than simple measures of time-on-platform, suggesting that qualitative aspects of engagement are critical to understanding harm versus benign use [1]. Neuroscientific investigations seeking structural brain changes analogous to those observed in substance addictions have produced limited and inconclusive results, underscoring the need for caution in drawing parallels between digital media use and established neurobiological addiction models [1].\n\nHeterogeneity in findings is a prominent feature of the literature: observed relationships vary by platform, population subgroup, and measurement approach, and study quality ranges from low to moderate, which complicates synthesis and interpretation [1]. These methodological variations contribute to uncertainty about prevalence, severity, and causal pathways of problematic behaviors. Consequently, research that integrates nuanced measures of motivation and behavior, employs longitudinal designs, and carefully distinguishes between different types of engagement is necessary to clarify which patterns are most predictive of adverse outcomes and under what conditions [1].\n\n### FoMO and compulsive checking\n\nFear of missing out (FoMO) is implicated as a driver of repetitive social media checking, forming a self-reinforcing cycle in which anxiety about social information leads to frequent platform visits and further anxiety when expectations are not met [1]. This compulsive checking behavior can become persistent, increasing the salience of social cues and perpetuating engagement even when it produces distress rather than satisfaction [1].\n\nFoMO-driven checking can exacerbate stress and contribute to feelings of social exclusion, effects that appear particularly pronounced among younger users who are more likely to engage in social comparison processes online [1]. In such populations, the combination of developmental sensitivity to peer evaluation and pervasive access to social information can intensify the negative emotional consequences of compulsive engagement, thereby reinforcing the problematic cycle [1].\n\n### Screen time, ADHD, and mood disorders\n\nLarge prospective studies have reported positive correlations between digital media use and symptoms associated with ADHD, and clinical descriptions of \"hyperfocus\" point to mechanisms by which some individuals may engage excessively with digital content [1]. For certain users, intense attentional capture by platform content can manifest as prolonged engagement that resembles attentional dysregulation, but the extent to which this constitutes a causal influence on ADHD symptoms is not established [1].\n\nCorrelational links between digital media use and depressive symptoms have also been observed, yet the directionality of this relationship remains unclear: individuals with depressive symptoms may seek online interactions or use digital media excessively as a coping strategy, while for others high levels of use may contribute to worsening mood [1]. Differing study designs and measures make it difficult to determine whether digital engagement is a precipitating factor, a consequence, or part of a reciprocal process with mood disorders [1].\n\nOverall, the quality of evidence on associations between screen time, ADHD symptoms, and mood disorders ranges from low to moderate, and findings differ substantially by platform type, population studied, and measurement approach employed. This variability highlights the importance of contextualizing reported associations and the need for more rigorous, targeted research to disentangle the complex relations among usage patterns, individual vulnerabilities, and mental health outcomes [1].",
    "## Positive and negative effects of social media\n\nSocial media platforms exhibit a dual potential, functioning both as supports for mental health—through peer support, access to information, and facilitation of social integration—and as sources of risk, including cyberbullying, exposure to harmful or sexualized content, and fostering unrealistic social comparisons that can undermine self-esteem and contribute to anxiety or depression [1]. This duality means that the same technological affordances that enable real‑time connection and information exchange can also amplify negative interpersonal experiences and exposure to problematic material [1].  \n\nEvidence indicates that moderate, structured use of social media is often linked with improved social integration and subjective well‑being among young people, and that particular platforms or online communities can serve therapeutic or supportive roles for users seeking connection or information [1]. Conversely, excessive engagement with social media specifically — distinct from total screen time — has been associated in some studies with poorer outcomes for young people, although many investigations report weak or inconsistent effects, leaving the magnitude and causality of such associations unsettled [1].  \n\nOutcomes of social media use are further moderated by the quality of content encountered and by individual susceptibility; negative effects may be transient for many users but can be sustained or severe for vulnerable individuals. Older adults (>65) may, on balance, experience net positive outcomes from social media use (often described as flourishing), but the direction of causality in these associations has not been established in the reviewed evidence [1].\n\n### Supportive uses and potential benefits\n\nParticipation in online support communities can yield tangible mental health benefits by providing social connection, mutual aid, and rapid access to information and resources, thereby reducing isolation and facilitating help‑seeking when needed [1]. These communities can function as spaces for shared experience and emotional support, which may be especially valuable when in‑person supports are limited or inaccessible [1].  \n\nReviews, including assessments by organisations such as the OECD, indicate that structured and limited internet use can support developmental and educational objectives for children and adolescents; when use is purposeful and bounded, it can contribute positively to learning, social development, and skill acquisition [1]. Such structured approaches to digital engagement therefore appear to be an important factor in realizing the potential benefits of social media for younger users [1].\n\n### Risks: cyberbullying, content exposure, and social comparison\n\nKey risks associated with social media involve cyberbullying, exposure to sexualized or substance‑related content, and repeated comparison with unrealistic portrayals of others, all of which can lower self‑esteem and contribute to symptoms of anxiety and depression for some users [1]. These adverse exposures do not affect all users equally: the psychological impact depends on both the nature of content encountered and individual factors such as preexisting vulnerability or sensitivity to social evaluation [1].  \n\nAlthough many negative effects may be transient for the general population, they can be serious and persistent for vulnerable individuals, underscoring the importance of considering individual susceptibility when evaluating harms. The literature also highlights that excessive time spent on social media, as distinct from aggregate screen time, is more consistently implicated in negative outcomes among young people, yet the overall evidence base contains inconsistencies and weak effects in many studies, limiting firm conclusions about causality and magnitude [1].",
    "## Adolescents, education, and vulnerable populations\n\nAdolescents exhibit a high prevalence of mental health disorders: approximately 46% of U.S. youth aged 13–18 experience a diagnosable mental disorder during their lifetime [3]. The concentration of research on adolescents reflects both the widespread uptake of digital technologies in this cohort [1] and the coincident emergence of many psychiatric conditions during these years [3]. Because of this confluence, adolescence is a primary focus for studies examining how social and digital media interact with developmental processes and mental health.\n\nMental health problems common in adolescence—particularly anxiety, depression, and attention-related disorders—are closely tied to educational outcomes. These conditions are associated with reduced attendance, lower academic achievement, diminished graduation rates, and difficulties with social integration in school settings [3]. The centrality of school to adolescents’ daily lives means that impairments in mental health frequently translate into measurable educational disadvantages, affecting both individual trajectories and broader school performance metrics [3].\n\nDigital media influence adolescents in complex and context-dependent ways. Effects vary by developmental stage, the social and educational context of use, and the purposes for which media are engaged; consequently, interventions aimed at reducing media exposure (for example, device removal) can produce mixed results, sometimes improving attention or family interaction and in other cases reducing opportunities for social connection or producing unintended effects on learning and family dynamics [1]. These nuances underscore the need to consider both developmental needs and patterns of media use when addressing adolescent mental health within educational contexts [1].\n\n### Prevalence and developmental impacts\n\nApproximately 46% of U.S. adolescents aged 13–18 experience a mental disorder at some point in their lifetime, and a substantial proportion of these young people do not receive formal support or treatment for their conditions [3]. This gap between need and formal services amplifies vulnerability during a developmental period marked by academic transitions, evolving peer relationships, and increasing autonomy, with implications that extend across social, emotional, and educational domains [3]. Because many adolescents rely on schools and informal supports, unmet clinical needs often surface in educational settings where their effects on functioning become evident [3].\n\nAnxiety and depression are among the most commonly reported disorders in adolescence and are linked to impaired school functioning, including difficulties concentrating, decreased participation, and increased absenteeism [3]. Social media–related processes—such as fear of missing out (FoMO) and upward social comparison—can exacerbate risks for anxious and depressive symptoms by increasing perceived social threat or perceived inadequacy relative to peers [1]. At the same time, moderate and purposeful digital engagement can facilitate peer connection and social integration, whereas excessive or problematic use is associated with poorer well-being; together these patterns indicate that digital engagement operates along a continuum with both potential benefits and risks depending on degree and context of use [1].\n\n### Academic outcomes and school-based responses\n\nStudents with emotional and behavioral disorders experience measurable educational disadvantages: they tend to have lower graduation rates and higher rates of school absenteeism compared with their peers, outcomes that reflect both symptom burden and challenges in maintaining consistent academic participation [3]. Classroom climates perceived as highly competitive have also been correlated with increased levels of depression and anxiety among students, suggesting that instructional environment and assessment practices can shape mental health as well as academic performance [3]. Such associations indicate that educational contexts can either mitigate or exacerbate the academic consequences of adolescent mental health problems.\n\nTo address these impacts, schools deploy a range of responses aimed at reducing educational disruption and supporting student functioning. Typical school-based strategies include targeted interventions and counseling services, mandatory mental health curricula, facilitation of support groups, and the use of structured identification tools to detect students in need of assistance [3]. These measures are intended to improve detection, provide timely supports, and help preserve attendance, achievement, and social integration for vulnerable students within the school setting [3].",
    "## Research design, evidence quality, and limitations\n\nThe literature assessing associations between social media use and mental health is dominated by correlational studies, and consequently causal relationships have not been established. Such a predominance of non-experimental designs limits the extent to which observed associations can be interpreted as evidence that social media use causes particular psychological outcomes rather than merely co-occurs with them [1].  \n\nA second central limitation is heterogeneity across studies in how use is measured, which populations are sampled, and which platforms are examined. Differences in operationalization—such as whether researchers measure raw time-on-platform, the subjective quality of interactions, user motivations, or the type of content encountered—generate inconsistent findings and contribute to an overall assessment of low-to-moderate evidence quality in the field [1]. These methodological inconsistencies, together with variation in study populations and platform contexts, complicate synthesis and reduce confidence in generalized conclusions.  \n\nSystematic reviews therefore caution against overinterpreting small negative associations reported in some studies. At least one recent review concluded that even when negative associations with adolescent well-being are detected, their magnitude may be minimal at the population level, underscoring the need for measured interpretation of effect sizes and public-health relevance rather than alarmist inferences [1].  \n\n### Measurement issues: time vs motivations/content\n\nTime-on-platform metrics are a blunt instrument for understanding psychological impact; they capture duration but not the purpose or subjective experience of use. By contrast, users’ motivations (for example, social connection, information-seeking, or entertainment) and the content they encounter appear to be more closely related to psychological outcomes than absolute minutes of use [1]. Platform-specific usage patterns and cultural contexts further modulate these relationships: findings from particular services (for instance, WeChat in some studies) illustrate that how and why people use a platform can matter more for well-being than aggregate screen time alone [1].  \n\n### Quality of evidence and interpretive caveats\n\nMany primary studies rely on self-report measures, cross-sectional designs, and samples that are not representative of broader populations, all of which reduce the ability to infer causation and limit external validity. These methodological constraints mean that observed associations should be interpreted with caution, and causal claims should be avoided unless supported by stronger longitudinal or experimental evidence [1]. Public and media discussions often fail to convey these nuances, at times overstating the certainty of harms or benefits; such misinterpretation can distort public understanding and policy debate in the absence of more rigorous evidence [1].",
    "## Prevention, clinical implications, and interventions\n\nThere are currently no standardized prevention or treatment protocols for problematic social media use; approaches in practice are heterogeneous and frequently derive concepts and techniques from behavioral addiction paradigms. [1] This lack of consensus has produced a landscape in which interventions and recommendations vary across professional groups and care settings. [1]\n\nGuidelines intended to promote safer media use among children and families have been developed and often emphasize coaching adolescents to build psychologically informed skills and competencies that support safer and more meaningful engagement with social media. [1, 3] However, the adoption and consistent implementation of these guidelines across households, schools, and clinical settings has been uneven, limiting their potential population-level impact. [1, 3]\n\nClinical responses to problematic social media use tend to be multifaceted, aiming both to address specific behavioral patterns and to identify and treat co-occurring psychiatric conditions. [1] Because diagnostic criteria and validated, condition-specific treatments remain lacking, clinical care is individualized and variable, and the evidence base for particular treatment modalities addressing social media–related harms is limited; further research is required to establish effective, standardized interventions. [1]\n\n### Guidelines and family/school strategies\n\nProfessional organizations and guideline developers recommend training and coaching adolescents to develop media skills and psychological competencies that enable safer, more intentional engagement with social platforms. [1, 3] These recommendations frame media use as a skill set that can be taught and supported by caregivers and professionals, emphasizing skill-building rather than solely prohibitive measures. [1, 3]\n\nSchools are encouraged to adopt complementary strategies that promote mental health awareness, provide accessible counseling resources, and integrate curricular elements that facilitate early identification and support for students with mental health needs related to media use. [1, 3] Such school-based actions are presented as important components of a broader, community-level approach to prevention and support. [1, 3]\n\n### Clinical treatment considerations\n\nClinicians frequently consider whether problematic social media use reflects or co-occurs with underlying psychiatric disorders and therefore often target comorbid conditions—such as depressive disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity presentations—alongside behavioral strategies aimed at modifying media use patterns. [1] This combined focus acknowledges that addressing underlying psychopathology may be necessary to achieve durable change in problematic engagement with social media. [1]\n\nBecause there is no agreed diagnostic framework specific to social media–related problems and no standardized treatment protocols, clinical care remains individualized and variable across providers and settings. [1] The diagnostic uncertainty constrains the accumulation of robust evidence for targeted interventions, underscoring the need for further research to validate specific therapeutic approaches and to inform standardization of care.

    "## Public debate, ethics, and media influence\n\nPublic debates about the mental fitness of high-profile figures illustrate how three forces—media selection, professional ethical constraints, and politicization—interact to shape public perceptions of mental health [2, 1]. Coverage that emphasizes certain behaviors or excerpts can foreground concerns about cognition or temperament, while concurrent ethical rules governing clinicians and partisan framing can amplify or attenuate public concern [2, 1]. These dynamics show that judgments circulated in the public sphere are not solely clinical assessments but are mediated by institutional norms and political contexts [2, 1].\n\nProfessional ethical norms serve as a crucial moderator of this public discourse by delineating what clinicians may appropriately say outside of direct clinical contexts. For example, guidance that limits clinicians from offering definitive public diagnoses without examination functions to protect professional integrity and individual rights, yet it also constrains the information available to the public during contentious debates [1]. At the same time, arguments for exceptions to such norms on the grounds of perceived public risk generate controversy, drawing media attention and contributing to polarized interpretations of both ethical responsibility and public safety [1, 2]. Thus, the interplay between ethical restraint and calls for public commentary fuels further media coverage and debate rather than resolving uncertainties.\n\n### Media framing and professional ethics\n\nMedia organizations may produce selective or coherent clips that, when presented without broader context, produce a distorted impression of an individual's cognitive or mental state [2]. Such selective framing affects how lay audiences interpret behaviors and statements, often simplifying complex clinical considerations into brief, emotionally salient narratives that can become the basis for public judgment [2].\n\nDebates about whether clinicians should publicly opine on public figures reveal a tension between adherence to professional ethical codes and perceived obligations to inform the public when there is alleged risk. Ethical guidelines that discourage public diagnosis without examination aim to protect both individuals and the profession, yet some clinicians and commentators contend that potential risks to the public justify exception or more expansive commentary; this conflict has been the source of notable controversy and sustained media coverage [1, 2]. The resulting interaction between media framing and professional ethics thus complicates efforts to maintain both ethical standards and public accountability in discussions of mental fitness."
