Regarded as a pop icon, he is known for his three-octave tenor vocal range, live performances, retro showmanship, and musical versatility. He is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans. Raised in Honolulu, Mars gained recognition in Hawaii as a child for his impersonation of Elvis Presley, before moving to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career.\nMars established his name in the music industry as a songwriter and co-founder of the production team the Smeezingtons. He rose to fame as a recording artist after featuring on the US number-one single \"Nothin' on You\" (2009) by B.o.B. Mars' first three studio albums—Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), and 24K Magic (2016)—found critical and commercial success, with the lattermost winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The albums spawned multiple international hit singles, including \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", \"The Lazy Song\", \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"When I Was Your Man\", \"Treasure\", \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", and \"Finesse\". He also featured on Mark Ronson's 2014 single \"Uptown Funk\", which became Billboard's best-performing song of the 2010s.\nMars' success continued throughout the 2020s. In 2021, he formed the musical superduo Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak, and they released the 1970s R&B-inspired album An Evening with Silk Sonic, which contained the US number-one single \"Leave the Door Open\". Mars' 2024 chart-topping duets \"Die with a Smile\" with Lady Gaga and \"Apt.\" with Rosé spent a total of 30 weeks atop the Billboard Global 200.\nMars has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has scored nine Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. His 24K Magic World Tour (2017–2018) ranks among the highest-grossing tours in history. Mars' accolades include 16 Grammy Awards (including 3 Records of the Year and 2 Songs of the Year), 14 American Music Awards, 4 Brit Awards, 14 Soul Train Awards, and 8 Guinness World Records. He has been featured on Music Week's best-songwriters (2011) and Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (2019) lists, as well as the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100 lists. Mars was the first artist with six RIAA diamond-certified songs and the first artist to surpass 150 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1985–2003: Early life and musical beginnings ===\nPeter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot. He was raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu. His father, originally from Brooklyn, New York, is of Puerto Rican and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with ancestral roots in Hungary and Ukraine. His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii and was of Filipino and Spanish ancestry. Hernandez’s parents met while performing in a show—his mother as a hula dancer and his father as a percussionist. At the age of two, he was nicknamed “Bruno” by his father, who thought he resembled professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.\nMars is one of six children and came from a musical family who exposed him to a diverse mix of musical genres, including rock and roll, reggae, hip hop, and rhythm and blues. His mother was a singer and a dancer and his father performed Little Richard's music, which inspired him as a young child. His uncle, an Elvis impersonator, encouraged the three-year-old Mars to perform songs by Presley and Michael Jackson. Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band (the Love Notes) at age four, including at the Sheraton Waikiki, and became known in Hawaii for his onstage impersonation of Elvis Presley. At one point, he urinated on himself during a performance of Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" when he was five; his parents thought they might be making a mistake, but he never wavered. Mars appeared in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as \"Little Elvis\" in 1990, and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.\nHe had a cameo role in the 1992 film Honeymoon in Vegas, and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years old, he appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show. He performed two shows a night throughout grade school with his family's band, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony songs. The young Mars had a small drum set, guitar, piano and percussion instruments, and learned to play them. His parents divorced when he was 12 (ending the Love Notes), and his father's varied businesses failed. Mars, his brother and father lived in the \"slums of Hawaii\" in a car, on rooftops, and in a closed bird zoo (Paradise Park) where his father had worked. Mars changed schools and was bullied, but later became popular.\nHis Elvis impersonations had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing technique. Mars began playing guitar, inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he acknowledged his Hawaii-raised roots and musical family as an influence: \"Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments ... I've just been surrounded by it.\" At President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu, Mars sang in a group (the School Boys) who opened for his father's new band with songs by the Isley Brothers and the Temptations. He became well known in local Hawaii entertainment in high school, opening for a large magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson for $75 per performance.\nAfter his sister in Los Angeles played a demo of Mars for Mike Lynn (head of A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school, Mars pursued a musical career. He lived on Mansfield Avenue, and was surprised by its poverty and squalor. Mars adopted his stage name from his father's childhood nickname, adding \"Mars\" at the end: \"I felt like I didn't have no pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I'm out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars.\" His stage name was also an effort to \"avoid being stereotyped\", since the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist and tried to convince him to sing in Spanish.\n\n\n=== 2004–2008: Career beginnings ===\nMars said about moving to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career:\n\nI'd always been a working musician in Hawaii and never had problems paying rent. And then it's like, \"Now I'm in L.A. and my phone's getting shut off\". That's when reality hit. I started DJing. I told this person I could DJ because they said they could pay me $75 cash under the table. I didn't know how to DJ. I lost that job pretty quick.\nMars signed a contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal \"went nowhere\" and he had a fruitless conversation with will.i.am's management. However, the singer's experience with Motown proved beneficial. After Mars was dropped by the label, less than a year later, he remained in Los Angeles and landed a 2005 music-publishing deal with record producers Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. According to Strang, \"Bruno came to the conclusion that the best way to further his career was writing and producing hit songs.\"\nLindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (whom Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would \"mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline.\" According to Lindsey, he \"held Mars back for five years while they learned an extensive catalog of hit music.\" Brown agreed in another interview. Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in Sex Panther, a band with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (Mars' brother, who became the drummer of the Hooligans).\nWhen Philip Lawrence was told he should meet Mars, he was reluctant to do so since he did not have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for the Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: \"Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you.\" Lawrence replied, \"Just give me five dollars back for the bus.\" The pair began collaborating on songs for Mars, but received a number of rejections from record labels. Lawrence introduced Mars to Aaron Bay-Schuck, his future A&R manager at Atlantic Records, in 2006. After hearing him play a couple of songs on guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately. It took about three years for Atlantic Records to sign Mars, however, because the label felt it was too early and he needed to develop as an artist.\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Production work and It's Better If You Don't Understand ===\nMars and Lawrence received a call in 2008 from Brandon Creed, who was seeking songs for a reunited Menudo. Creed liked their song \"Lost\", which was written for Mars, and bought it for $20,000. The sale enabled them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs for other artists. Eventually Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.\nMars was a music producer before becoming a successful solo artist, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and K'naan. He said that the first \"big hit\" he and Lawrence wrote was the 2009 single, \"Right Round\", by Flo Rida: \"That was our first taste of what could really happen with a hit we hundred-percented\". Mars co-wrote the Sugababes's \"Get Sexy\" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album, Sweet 7 (2010). He sang on the track \"3D\" on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal (2009). Mars appeared on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single, \"Love\", and American rapper Travie McCoy's \"One at a Time\" (a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation) that year. He was recognized as a solo artist after appearing on American rapper B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" (2009) and McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010); both songs peaked in the top ten of several music charts, with the former topping the United States Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.\nMars said about the singles, \"I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of 'Nothin' on You', it might've sounded like some '90s R&B.\" He released his debut extended play (EP), It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. It peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard 200, and a music video was released for \"The Other Side\" with singer CeeLo Green and B.o.B. Mars and the Smeezingtons composed Green's successful 2010 single, \"Fuck You\".\n\n\n=== 2010–2012: Doo-Wops and Hooligans ===\n\nMars released \"Just the Way You Are\" on July 20, 2010, as the lead single of his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, produced primarily by the Smeezingtons. It topped the charts of several countries, including Australia, Canada and the U.S. The album, released on October 5, 2010, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the UK, Dutch and Canadian. Doo-Wops & Hooligans has sold 15.5 million copies worldwide. It spawned two other singles: \"Grenade\" (which topped the Billboard Hot 100, New Zealand, UK, and other charts) and \"The Lazy Song\", which topped the UK and Danish charts.\nOther singles include \"Talking to the Moon\", which was released in Brazil and topped Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay charts. \"Marry You\" was released internationally and \"Count On Me\" was the album's final single in Australia. Mars released \"It Will Rain\" on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 film soundtrack (2011). The single reached number three in the U.S. and number two in New Zealand. He appeared on \"Mirror\" with rapper Lil Wayne, \"Lighters\" with the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil and \"Young, Wild & Free\" wi\n\n---\n\nIndex: 2\nTitle: 24K Magic (album)\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24K_Magic_(album)\nContent: 24K Magic is the third studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released by Atlantic Records on November 18, 2016. Mars reunited with Philip Lawrence and Christopher Brody Brown, who composed the album under their joint alias Shampoo Press & Curl. Mars enlisted new composers including the Stereotypes and James Fauntleroy. Recording sessions for 24K Magic took place between late 2015 and September 2016 at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California.\nSeveral critics said 24K Magic was crafted from elements of R&B, funk, pop, and new jack swing. Mars was inspired to create an album on which he could capture the sound of 1990s R&B, that he listened and danced to during his childhood. He wanted to make people dance and have the same enjoyment he had. The lyrics of 24K Magic explore themes similar to those of its predecessor, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), including money and sex. According to Mars, although he was able to convince Atlantic Records of the album's sound, they were initially hesitant.\n24K Magic debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 231,000 equivalent album units and became Mars's first number-one album on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. It also peaked at number two in Canada, France, and New Zealand, and produced five singles: \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", and \"Finesse\" (remix featuring Cardi B), which were commercially successful while \"Versace on the Floor\" charted moderately and \"Chunky\" had a limited release. \"That's What I Like\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Mars's seventh number-one song in the United States, while \"24K Magic\" peaked at number one in New Zealand. The album sold five million units globally and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Music Canada (MC), and Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ).\nCritical responses to 24K Magic were generally favorable; many reviewers noticed the change of style, focusing on contemporary R&B and the improvement on the production. Others criticized the detachment from the casual listener and the lack of \"vulnerability\" from his previous ballads. At the 2018 Grammy Awards 24K Magic won seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best R&B Album, while the title track won Record of the Year and \"That's What I Like\" won Song of The Year at the same ceremony. Several publications listed the album as one of the best records of the year and the Associated Press named it as the tenth-best album of the 2010s. The album was also promoted through the 24K Magic World Tour (2017–2018), along with a number of television appearances.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn early 2014, Bruno Mars was interviewed by that's Shanghai and gave some details of a new album, stating, \"I want to write better songs ... put on better shows ... make better music videos. I want my next album to be better than the first and the second.\" In September 2014, Mars tweeted, \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\", hinting that he was working on new music. Following the release of British-American musician Mark Ronson and Mars's single \"Uptown Funk\" (2014), Mars went to the studio to record more songs; he said he had no plans to release a new album \"until it's done\". Mars's new album was due in March 2016 but its release was postponed for several months because of his appearance at that year's Super Bowl half-time show. At the time, seven songs were already recorded. Mars worked with Canadian recording engineer Charles Moniz, who called the album the \"next movement of Bruno\" and confirmed the album was close to being finished in February 2016. Mars also worked with American musician Andrew Wyatt, who was involved in Mars's previous studio albums, and American bass guitarist Jamareo Artis, of The Hooligans, who said they had been \"trying different ideas and experimenting\" and \"It's going to have a new sound ... the material is very groove-oriented\". Mars also worked with American rapper Missy Elliott, but he said they were just hanging out.\nIn an interview with New Zealand radio DJ Zane Lowe for the Apple Music podcast Beats 1, Mars said the album is filled with 1990s influences. Mars concluded; \"I just want to do music. I want to be the guy that brings joy to your life through his music.\" Mars affirmed he felt he was correct to record nine songs, saying; \"If I can't pull you in with nine songs, I'm not gonna pull you in with nineteen!\" He told that the album was inspired by a non-existent movie that he visualized. Mars said it featured \"a Versace-wearing pimp\" in New York during a summer night at the \"baddest rooftop house party. 2:30 in the morning, the band comes out, fucking dipped in Versace. The girls are screaming.\" Mars stated this album contrasts with his others, on which he would experiment with genres: \"I wanted to really hone it in and give myself a world in which I could keep it contained ... I want to sing more so than I did on the other albums\". He chose to emulate \"the feeling of the R&B he fell in love with as a kid\", avoiding making it sound like a tribute or forced, taking inspiration from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley, Mariah Carey and Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds. In November 2017, Mars was a guest on the Charlie Rose Show and said as he grew up pop music was \"R&B-rooted songs\", which he danced to at school balls and barbecues. Mars wanted to achieve the same \"feeling and emotion\", concluding \"it was fun to dance, it was cool to smile on the dance floor with a girl and flirt with a girl on the dance floor\". To achieve his aim to make people want to dance again, he needed the songs to make him dance. Mars was inspired by his passion \"for R&B acts\"; he said that was the feeling they wanted the album to have. He added, \"it was all about the live show and the kind of party I want to throw\".\nAlthough Mars was able to convince Atlantic Records of the album's sound, they were initially hesitant. A private album listening party was held at Atlantic's offices in New York City for several journalists.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMars reunited with frequent collaborators, American songwriter, and producers, Philip Lawrence and Christopher Brody Brown, forming a new production trio, Shampoo Press & Curl, to record 24K Magic. It was recorded at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California between the fall 2015 and September 2016. Nevertheless, the singer returned to the studio on the first week of October to complete the album. Mars revealed that he was not confident about returning to the studio after releasing \"Uptown Funk\" (2014) and was struggling to write new songs. On top of that, he added that it took him so long to create a song, he needed to \"touch an instrument or it won't come out. If I'm not touching the guitar or touching the drum machine or playing the piano, the song just won't come out.\" He imposed a dress code in the studio during the recording process, favoring jewelry and \"fine clothes\" over sweatpants to create the \"groovy, smooth and soulful songs\" on the record.\nLawrence said, \"We got the sitting in the studio laboring over songs for hours and days and weeks\". He furthered that playing new songs live while recording helped. They noticed what was or not working and what it could be improved. \"Finesse\" underwent twenty different versions, including one in which Mars sang about \"gold chains and cognac over a silky beat\", and another which sounded \"like a Seventies cop show\". \"Versace on the Floor\" started with a \"piña colada vibe\" before the beat was remixed, though, Mars felt his vocal performance and lyrics were not emotive enough for a ballad, and changed the melody and re-wrote the track. The singer-songwriter took a long time to write \"Too Good to Say Goodbye\". It was not complete until Babyface heard the chorus, encouraging the former to complete the song. They composed the song together on a piano. Mars used a flexatone, a percussion instrument, on the album, given to him by DJ Quik.\n\nMars asked American singer-songwriter James Fauntleroy to help him write \"That's What I Like\", but Fauntleroy end-up co-writing most of the songs on the album. Fauntleroy said; \"Bruno is the core of those songs and Phil is a huge part of the reason those songs sound like that.\" He added that despite having a good time with them, it was \"probably the most intense album process of my life\". American record producer and DJ Skrillex said he and Mars were creating something \"different, awesome and next level and sounds like nothing else that's happened before\". He also affirmed that they could work on \"more of a Skrillex thing\". The song they were working on was not completed in time for the album's release. American rapper T-Pain who worked on \"Straight Up & Down\", said he saw Mars and his band, with the engineer \"jamming out and having a good time\". T-Pain affirmed Mars \"was real specific about what he wanted\".\nThe Stereotypes, a production team, were also involved in the album's composition. They have worked with Mars since 2007, however, after the singer signed a deal with Atlantic Records they did not collaborate very often. Nevertheless, in 2015, Jonathan Yip, a member of the Stereotypes, talked with Mars about working together. The latter asked for \"some beats\" for 24K Magic, but \"nothing came of it\". In June 2016, Mars asked Yip if they would like to help him finish a song for his album. He needed another song with a certain tempo and key. Yip sent Mars an idea that caught his attention, and he asked the Stereotypes to come to the studio. Once in the studio, it took them some time to \"get the groove\" on the track. They spent the first couple of hours catching up and having fun. The Stereotypes helped Mars finishing \"24K Magic\" and \"That's What I Like\". They also created \"Finesse\" with Shampoo Press & Curl. The team noticed that Mars \"is his own biggest critic\", a \"perfectionist\".\nIn August 2016, the album entered the mixing stage. Romanian-American mixing engineer Serban Ghenea had to return to his early career as an R&B and hip-hop engineer, to come up with the \"esthetic\" for 24K Magic. He explained, \"the idea was to have a '90s R&B/hip-hop-influenced album, but with a modern sonic presentation\". Moniz told they would felt great regarding a certain song and Mars wanted to \"push it further\" as he wanted 24K Magic to be \"the foundation for his live show\". The singer would ask to imagine the songs being performed live, to know their feeling and if they were danceable. The engineer confessed they would start to work in the afternoon and spent 14 hours in the studio each day, with the album taking 22 months to record and once the writing stopped, the singer would \"bounce ideas around the room.\" He said Mars and his team were set to create an R&B album as \"it's a part of who they are\". Mars was close to the mixing process describing what he wanted for the album.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\n24K Magic explores several genres, including, R&B, funk, pop, and new jack swing. Andy Kellman of AllMusic, thinks the album \"might as well be considered the full-length sequel to \"Uptown Funk\"; Mars abandoned his previous new wave and reggae sound for an \"all-out R&B\" effort. The album includes the R&B ballads \"Versace on the Floor\", \"Straight Up & Down\" and \"Too Good To Say Goodbye\". \"24K Magic\", \"Chunky\" and \"Perm\" are funk tracks, while \"Calling All My Lovelies\" is an R&B heartbreaker song. 24K Magic also features new jack swing, hip-hop soul and funk on the tracks \"Finesse\" and \"That's What I Like\", with the latter also being an R&B song. Lyrics on the album are themed around money and sex.\nThe album opens with a talk box on \"24K Magic\"; the track's synthesizer riff and backbeat are inspired by \"The Message\" (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Its lyrics celebrate extravagance, glamour, and the party lifestyle. \"Chunky\" is an electro-funk track that features synthesizers and\n\n---\n\nIndex: 3\nTitle: Bonde do Brunão\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonde_do_Brun%C3%A3o\nContent: \"Bonde do Brunão\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars.

The singer also parodies with \"the use of humor demonstrate the intention to play with the original theme, redefining its message.\" It is also seen as a collaboration despite being produced by foreign artists as it displays \"respect and recognition for Brazilian culture.\"\n\n\n== Fortnite Festival and live performances ==\nFortnite included an emote of Mars inspired on the dance of \"Bonde do Brunão\" and skin titled \"Estilo Bruninho\" with a yellow and green t-shirt inspired on the one he used on his Instagram post. On the game, Mars transforms into a playable avatar with a skin based on the song. Players would be able to acquire certain items in-game individually and some were exclusive to the \"World Tour\" bundle.\nAt the beginning of his show Mars said \"Bruninho, voltou\" an enounces \"porra\". During Mars's tour in Brazil, the performance of \"Perm\" included the verses \"Desce até o chão, esse é o bonde do Brunão\". During the song \"Calling all My Lovelies\", he added the words \"gatinha\", \"gostosa\" and the verse \"eu quero você, gatinha gostosa\" as he holds a telephone, waiting for the call to be answered, but ending on the voice mail. Some songs are played in the piano during his live shows, Mars also mentioned where are the \"solteiras\" and that he is \"facinho\".\n\n\n== Impact ==\nIn 2023, Nathalia Nunes, branding and experience design specialist, commented on the video \"This trail from before, during, and after the show was crucial for stimulating and building fan loyalty\".\nIn 2024, Ludmilla Correia from Bilboard Brasil noticed the singer \"has been...riding the Brazil Core wave. This movement...has reached the world of music and even fashion, consists of representing national identity through colors and symbols.\" Guilherme Umeda, social communicator and PhD professor of design at ESPM college commented, \"This type of video is becoming a formula not only for other artists, but also for Bruno himself. There's calculation, planning, and intentionality\". After Mars action, other musicians such as Ne-Yo, Simple Plan, and Karol G created interactions, publications, and special products, exclusive to Brazil.\nIn 2024, Mars performed a charity concert sponsored by Budweiser Brasil at the Tokio Marine Hall in São Paulo to help victims of the 2024 Rio Grande do Sul floods. After selling out the original shows scheduled. Four more extra shows were added to the tour, the official ticket booth lines for pre-sale and general ticket sales had collection points for donations of water, non-perishable food, and clothing brought by fans to be given to those affected by the floods in Rio Grande do Sul.\nDuring Mars's stay in Brazil, besides performing 15 shows, he celebrated his birthday, attended cultural events and also watched a soccer game in Maracanã, as well as going to tradional bars in São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. He received a symbolic CPF, given by the Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services.\nIn early November 2024, Mars visited Laçador, a bar in Belo Horizonte, propriety of Ronaldo Teixeira.

He told the bar owner \"chama os meninos!\", Teixeira called everyone around, they sat next to the bar's door while Mars danced, later Teixeira joined him. Later, Mars published a video, with the song, that included the bar, Laçador, according to Teixeira the bar became a tourist hot spot. The bar not only improved its sales numbers, but also the beer brand \"Laçador\" sponsored the place, buying chairs, tables and some other stuff everything with Mars's face on it.

    "abstract": "This structured knowledge base synthesizes Bruno Mars's music career using three primary Wikipedia documents covering his biography, the 24K Magic album, and the Brazil-focused single 'Bonde do Brunão'. It captures Mars's development from a child performer in Honolulu to an internationally successful singer-songwriter-producer. Key methods in his career include disciplined songwriting apprenticeship, collaborative production teams (Smeezingtons; Shampoo Press & Curl), and a deliberate retro-modern aesthetic that channels R&B, funk, soul and new jack swing. Major milestones are documented: breakthrough features ('Nothin' on You', 'Billionaire'), the debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), stylistic expansion on Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), and the concept-driven 24K Magic (2016) which prioritized groove-based, danceable arrangements and won multiple Grammys including Album of the Year. The summary also covers Mars's live performance ethos (The Hooligans, Super Bowl, 24K Magic World Tour), collaborative projects (Silk Sonic), commercial metrics (150+ million records sold, diamond certifications, streaming milestones), and recent culturally specific outreach exemplified by 'Bonde do Brunão'—a Portuguese-language Brazilian funk tribute that leveraged social media virality and gaming partnership (Fortnite). Across topics, the synthesis emphasizes Mars's hybrid role as performer, songwriter and producer, his consistent commercial success, and his practice of marrying era-authentic production with contemporary pop sensibilities to sustain broad popular and industry acclaim.",
    "conclusion": "Bruno Mars's music career is defined by early immersion in live performance, disciplined songwriting and production craft, and a purposeful revivalist approach that blends vintage R&B/funk aesthetics with contemporary pop. His trajectory—from behind-the-scenes songwriter to multi-platinum solo artist and collaborative projects like Silk Sonic—demonstrates versatility in studio production, performance, and audience engagement. Commercial milestones (over 150 million records sold, multiple No.1 singles, high-grossing tours) and critical recognition (numerous Grammys and industry honors) affirm his impact. Recent work, including localized, culturally engaged releases like 'Bonde do Brunão', shows an ongoing strategy of direct fan interaction, cross-cultural collaboration, and multimedia promotion, reinforcing his role as a global pop/R&B curator and enduring live entertainer."

    "## Early life and musical beginnings\n\nPeter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, into a musical family whose eclectic tastes included rock, reggae, hip hop, and R&B, a milieu that shaped his later multi-genre fluency and stagecraft [1]. From an early age he performed publicly as part of the family's act, adopting an Elvis impersonator persona at approximately three to four years old and appearing regularly at hotels and local events, which earned him early local recognition and practical experience onstage [1]. During childhood he developed skills on multiple instruments, including guitar, piano, percussion, and drums, while his vocal delivery and showmanship were strongly influenced by impersonations of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson [1]. Family instability, including his parents' divorce and periods of economic hardship, intersected with sustained performance practice through adolescence and informed both his resilience and continued engagement with music [1]. After finishing high school he relocated to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a professional music career and adopted the stage name Bruno Mars to avoid stereotyping and to create a distinct public persona [1].\n\n### Childhood performance and influences\n\nThe formative years of Hernandez's performance career were rooted in family shows at Waikiki venues and in televised appearances, which together provided structured opportunities to build stage experience and confidence from a young age [1]. His early work as an Elvis Presley impersonator and later homage to Michael Jackson informed a retro-oriented showmanship that included choreography and particular vocal phrasing, elements that would reappear in his professional performances [1]. At home he was exposed to a broad array of musical styles—his father's admiration for Little Richard and his mother's singing and dancing, among other influences—producing a wide stylistic palette that became foundational for his later genre-blending approach [1].\n\n### Relocation to Los Angeles and early career struggles\n\nUpon relocating to Los Angeles in 2003, Hernandez encountered financial hardships and supplemented his pursuits with various jobs, such as DJing, while actively networking within the music industry [1]. He experienced a brief recording contract with Motown Records in 2004 that did not result in released material, after which a 2005 music-publishing deal shifted his trajectory toward songwriting and production work [1]. During this period he met key collaborators—Brody Brown, Jeff Bhasker, and Philip Lawrence—and participated in early bands such as Sex Panther; these associations laid the groundwork for the formation of the Smeezingtons and his subsequent production and songwriting career [1].",
    "## Songwriting and production career (Smeezingtons & beyond)\n\nBefore his breakout as a solo artist, he established a reputation as a songwriter and producer and co-founded the production team the Smeezingtons with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine [1, 2]. This production work included writing and producing for a range of other artists—among them Flo Rida ('Right Round'), Alexandra Burke, Brandy, K'naan, and Sugababes—which both validated the team's approach to pop songwriting and provided industry credibility as well as financial runway for subsequent solo efforts [1]. He also co-wrote and was featured on high-profile early hits such as B.o.B.'s \"Nothin' on You\" (2009) and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010), appearances that substantially increased his visibility as a solo artist [1]. Central to this period was a songwriting approach that emphasized deliberate study of pop-song construction through mentorship under Steve Lindsey and disciplined catalog analysis to craft commercially effective hooks and structures [1, 2].\n\n### Smeezingtons and production methods\n\nThe Smeezingtons' production method combined his multi-instrumental abilities with the complementary production techniques of his collaborators to create polished pop and R&B tracks [1, 2]. This collaboration produced arrangements that balanced live instrumentation and contemporary production practices, with attention to clarity and mainstream appeal [1, 2]. Mentorship and disciplined catalog study under guidance from Steve Lindsey formed a core part of the team's creative practice; the team regularly practiced writing and reverse-engineering successful hits to internalize the structures and devices that make pop songs effective [1, 2]. Within this framework, his role encompassed instrumentation, vocal arrangement, and co-writing, with an emphasis on crafting arrangements that would translate effectively to live performance [1, 2].\n\n### Writing for others and breakout features\n\nEarly outside cuts such as Flo Rida's \"Right Round\" represented the team's first major commercial successes and served to validate their pop-writing methodology in the marketplace [1]. These placements for other artists established the Smeezingtons' reputation and brought tangible commercial returns that supported further work and investment in solo projects [1]. His featured appearances on B.o.B.'s \"Nothin' on You\" and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" functioned as mainstream introductions for his vocal and melodic work, demonstrating his capacity to deliver memorable hooks in guest roles and raising his profile among a broader audience [1]. The revenue and recognition produced by this body of production and songwriting work enabled him to fund his own recordings and to secure later label support for his rollout as a solo artist [1].",
    "## Major studio albums and musical evolution\n\nBruno Mars's first three studio albums—Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), and 24K Magic (2016)—represent distinct stylistic phases in his recorded output, each achieving substantial commercial success and exerting influence on contemporary pop and R&B trends [1, 2]. Across these records Mars consistently blended retro influences drawn from R&B, funk, soul, and new jack swing with contemporary pop production techniques, creating a sound that honored earlier popular music forms while remaining radio-friendly and modern [1, 2]. This synthesis is paired with an emphasis on live-band arrangements and showmanship, a through-line in both studio presentation and the artist’s larger performance aesthetic [1, 2].\n\nConcurrently, Mars’s collaborative production model evolved over this period. His early work was largely shaped by the Smeezingtons, a production collective that dominated the sound and songwriting on his initial releases, while later projects—most notably 24K Magic—were credited primarily to Shampoo Press & Curl with additional contributions from producers such as the Stereotypes and James Fauntleroy, reflecting a shift toward broader collaborative arrangements and more specialized production inputs [1, 2]. This evolution in production personnel accompanied deliberate aesthetic shifts between albums, with each record articulating its own thematic and sonic identity while maintaining continuity through Mars’s vocal presence and melodic sensibility [1, 2].\n\n### Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010)\n\nDoo-Wops & Hooligans served as Bruno Mars’s debut solo album and established him as a commercial and chart-topping artist, led by major singles such as \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade,\" both of which reached top positions on global charts [1]. The album juxtaposed pop balladry with upbeat, accessible tracks, yielding multiple international hits including \"The Lazy Song\" and \"Marry You,\" and thereby demonstrating a capacity for broad commercial appeal across tempos and styles [1].\n\nThe record’s commercial impact was substantial, with approximately 15.5 million copies sold worldwide, a figure that underscores its global reach and enduring popularity [1]. Critical and popular recognition of the album centered on Mars’s vocal range, melodic songwriting, and production that balanced retro sensibilities with contemporary polish, qualities that anchored the album’s successes and established the artistic template he would develop in subsequent releases [1].\n\n### Unorthodox Jukebox (2012)\n\nUnorthodox Jukebox expanded Mars’s stylistic palette beyond the parameters of his debut by incorporating elements of rock, disco, and R&B, thereby broadening the album’s sonic range and demonstrating increased genre versatility [1]. The sophomore LP produced notable hits such as \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"When I Was Your Man,\" both of which sustained Mars’s presence on major charts and reinforced his position in the mainstream pop landscape [1].\n\nThis record further solidified Mars’s reputation for songwriting craft and adaptable genre fluency, positioning him for larger-scale productions and a wider array of collaborative opportunities in subsequent projects [1]. The expanded stylistic ambitions of Unorthodox Jukebox thus functioned as a bridge between the melodic pop foundations of the debut and the more deliberately retro and groove-oriented direction that followed [1].\n\n### 24K Magic (2016): concept, recording, and reception\n\n24K Magic marked a conscious return to and reimagining of late twentieth-century R&B, funk, and new jack swing influences, with the album’s concept framed around a stylized party and rooftop nightlife narrative that Mars described creatively as akin to a \"non-existent movie\" guiding the record’s aesthetic [2, 1]. The recording sessions took place during 2015–2016 at Glenwood Place Studios and emphasized groove, a live-band feel, and careful mixing intended to evoke a 1990s aesthetic while preserving contemporary sonic clarity [2, 1].\n\nProduction was principally credited to Shampoo Press & Curl, with additional contributions from the Stereotypes and James Fauntleroy; this collaborative framework supported the album’s focus on tight arrangements and rhythmic detail [2, 1]. Singles from the album included the title track \"24K Magic,\" \"That's What I Like,\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"Finesse,\" whose remix featuring Cardi B further amplified the album’s commercial visibility [2, 1]. Upon release the album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and sold approximately 5 million units worldwide, reflecting both strong immediate impact and continued audience interest [2, 1].\n\nCritical response to 24K Magic was generally favorable, with praise directed at its production quality and throwback sound; however, some critics observed a relative reduction in the emotional vulnerability that characterized earlier ballads from Mars [2, 1]. The album’s industry recognition was significant: it won seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best R&B Album, consolidating Mars’s status as a leading figure in contemporary pop and R&B [2, 1].",
    "## Singles, chart performance and signature hits\n\nBruno Mars has achieved multiple global hits across his career, registering at least nine Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and scoring numerous international chart-toppers [1, 2]. These chart accomplishments have been anchored by a set of widely recognized signature singles that span his early ballad-driven breakout through later funk and pop-oriented work; notable examples include \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"When I Was Your Man\", \"Treasure\", \"24K Magic\", and \"That's What I Like\" [1, 2]. Collectively, these tracks illustrate a trajectory from emotive pop songwriting to retro-inflected, high-production pop and R&B that sustained mainstream appeal across multiple album cycles [1, 2].\n\nHigh-profile collaborations have amplified Mars's reach and reinforced his mainstream prominence. His prominent feature on Mark Ronson's \"Uptown Funk\" (2014) became a cultural phenomenon and was commercially dominant, later being cited as Billboard's best-performing song of the 2010s, and his subsequent leadership in Silk Sonic compositions further extended his artistic footprint [1, 2]. These collaborative successes reinforced Mars's versatility, enabling cross-genre penetration and reinforcing public visibility beyond his solo releases [1, 2].\n\nMars has also attained significant industry certifications and streaming milestones that reflect both longevity and mass consumption. He was the first artist to achieve six RIAA diamond-certified songs, a distinction that underscores repeated, high-volume commercial performance, and he reached sizable streaming audiences such as surpassing 150 million monthly Spotify listeners at one point, demonstrating his digital-era prominence [1, 2]. These combined certification and streaming achievements corroborate the commercial and cultural weight of his singles across traditional and modern consumption metrics [1, 2].\n\n### Notable collaborations and features\n\nEarly in his career, Mars gained widespread exposure through breakout features that introduced his melodic voice to broader audiences. Appearances on B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" served as pivotal early collaborations that foregrounded his vocal identity and helped transition him from behind-the-scenes songwriter and supporting artist into a recognized pop performer [1]. These early features played a formative role in establishing the public familiarity that later supported his solo chart success [1].\n\nThe collaboration with Mark Ronson on \"Uptown Funk\" functioned as a cultural watershed, marrying retro-funk aesthetics with mainstream pop dominance and substantially elevating Mars's global profile [1]. Collaboration remained a strategic element of his career into the 2020s: Mars co-fronted Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak and continued to release duet singles and pairings (including notable 2024 pairings) that extended his chart presence and showcased his facility with collaborative, performance-driven projects [1]. These ongoing partnerships highlight a consistent pattern in which high-profile features and joint projects have expanded both his artistic range and commercial reach [1].",
    "## Live performance, touring and The Hooligans\n\nBruno Mars's live identity has been a defining element of his career, characterized by a three-octave tenor vocal range, retro showmanship, and a backing band—the Hooligans—that is integral to reproducing his multi-genre studio sound in concert [1, 2]. This combination of vocal versatility and period-informed performance aesthetics enables a live presentation that intentionally references and revitalizes earlier popular music styles while maintaining contemporary appeal [1, 2]. The Hooligans function not merely as accompaniment but as a cohesive unit that recreates the rhythmic, harmonic, and textural elements of Mars's recordings onstage, supporting choreography and audience interaction that are central to the concert experience [1, 2].\n\nTelevised and spectacle performances have played a consequential role in amplifying Mars's global profile. His Super Bowl halftime show in 2016 served as a major televised showcase that broadened his international visibility and contributed to subsequent strategic decisions regarding his recorded output, including a delayed release of 24K Magic to accommodate touring and promotional considerations [1, 2]. Such high-profile appearances functioned both as mass-media platforms and as moments that linked his live persona to wider commercial and promotional trajectories [1, 2].\n\nThe translation of recorded success into large-scale live revenue and fan engagement was most evident in the 24K Magic World Tour (2017–2018), which ranked among the highest-grossing tours of its period and demonstrated Mars's capacity to mobilize substantial concert audiences worldwide [1, 2]. The tour's commercial performance underscored the artist's ability to convert popular recordings into sustained live demand, reinforcing his position within the contemporary live-music economy and evidencing the economic significance of tightly staged, genre-spanning shows [1, 2].\n\n### Tour production and commercial impact\n\nMars's tour production emphasizes choreography, wardrobe, and the musicianship of the Hooligans to create immersive, dance-driven performances that deliberately evoke the musical eras his work draws from [1, 2]. Choreography and costume design function as deliberate aesthetic signifiers that, together with live instrumental performance, produce an integrated sensory environment; this integration permits audiences to experience a stylized continuity between recorded influences and live enactment [1, 2]. The band’s technical proficiency and stylistic versatility are presented as essential components of this theatricality, enabling faithful and dynamic renditions of material that spans R&B, funk, soul, and pop idioms [1, 2].\n\nCommercially, the 24K Magic World Tour reinforced Mars's reputation for tightly produced, high-energy shows that appeal across demographics, contributing to its placement among the top-grossing global tours of the period [1, 2]. The tour’s financial and attendance outcomes evidenced broad market reach and the effectiveness of an integrated production strategy that combines nostalgic aesthetics with contemporary pop presentation, thereby sustaining both critical recognition for live craft and measurable commercial success [1, 2].",
    "## Silk Sonic and recent collaborative projects\n\nIn 2021 Mars formed Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak, a collaboration that produced An Evening with Silk Sonic, an album explicitly modeled on 1970s R&B aesthetics and featuring the US No. 1 single \"Leave the Door Open\" [1]. The project's commercial performance, signaled by the chart success of its lead single, exemplifies the capacity of era-specific collaborations to attain mainstream visibility within contemporary popular music markets [1].\n\nSilk Sonic's recordings emphasized period-authentic production techniques, tight vocal harmonies, and retro instrumentation drawn from 1970s soul and R&B conventions, creating a sonic palette that deliberately referenced earlier recording practices and arrangements [1]. These aesthetic choices aligned with Mars's documented interest in vintage R&B forms, reinforcing a continuity between his solo work and collaborative ventures that prioritize historical stylistic fidelity [1].\n\nMore broadly, such collaborative projects have enabled Mars to explore narrower, more focused genre frames—exemplified by the 1970s soul orientation of Silk Sonic—while preserving mainstream commercial success and broad audience reach [1]. By situating artistic experimentation within partnership formats, these projects extend Mars's creative range without severing the commercial trajectories established through his solo releases [1].\n\n### Artistic rationale and outcomes\n\nSilk Sonic functioned as a vehicle for both artists to foreground duet-led soul performance, placing emphasis on vocal interplay and call-and-response techniques central to classic soul traditions; the collaboration also showcased instrumental flourishes and an emphasis on live-feeling interplay among musicians [1]. This mode of performance foregrounded collaborative musicianship over solo virtuosity and allowed visible articulation of shared stylistic commitments to vintage soul idioms [1].\n\nThe project yielded both critical and commercial acclaim, reinforcing Mars's identity as a curator and performer of retro-rooted pop and expanding his discography beyond solo-led albums into collaborative, era-specific works [1]. By occupying the role of an interpreter and steward of historical styles within a collaborative context, Mars broadened his artistic profile while consolidating a brand associated with meticulous retro production and stylistic homage [1].",
    "## Engagement with Brazil and 'Bonde do Brunão' (2024–2025)\n\n'Bonde do Brunão' is a Portuguese-language, Brazilian funk–inspired track that was released on June 18, 2025 and that originated as a tour improvisation performed in Brazil before gaining traction on social media platforms. [1] The recording capitalized on its viral origins, translating moments from live improvisation into a studio single that foregrounded Brazilian rhythmic elements and Portuguese lyrical phrasing. [1]\n\nThe single was produced in collaboration with the production collective the Stereotypes and incorporated contributions from Brazilian musicians and cultural references, positioning the release as both a commercial single and a localized artistic exchange connected to the artist’s Brazil performances. [1] As part of its rollout, the song was used in promotional material for the Brazil shows and was selected for integration into Fortnite Festival Season 9, extending the track’s audience through gaming platforms and digital cross-promotion. [1]\n\nReception to the track was mixed-to-positive: several commentators framed it as a tribute and an instance of cultural exchange that highlighted Brazilian funk influences, while other observers raised concerns about cultural appropriation and the boundaries of such exchanges. [1] The release also produced tangible local effects, provoking media commentary on cultural interaction, generating increased commercial interest for locations featured in associated visual media, and prompting charitable engagements linked to the Brazil concerts. [3]\n\n### Development, composition, release and impact\n\nThe song’s development began as an Instagram and on-tour improvisation in São Paulo and evolved into a fully produced single after it achieved viral traction on social media—accumulating millions of likes and views—which prompted an official release through Atlantic and Smeezingtons and facilitated its inclusion in Fortnite. [3] This trajectory from live improvisation to recorded single illustrates how contemporary digital virality can convert ephemeral performance moments into formal releases and cross-media placements. [3]\n\nMusically, the track adapts the artist’s vocal delivery to Brazilian funk cadences, incorporates Portuguese slang and local references, and performs a mixture of parody and tribute to elements of Brazilian funk classics; Brazilian production professionals were involved in the process to enhance stylistic authenticity and local grounding. [3] These compositional choices aimed to align the song with recognizable features of the genre while retaining elements of the artist’s established performance identity. [3]\n\nThe release strategy combined social platforms such as Instagram and TikTok with gaming tie-ins like the Fortnite Festival to maximize reach, and live performances subsequently incorporated lines from the song into existing setlists to increase local audience engagement. [3] Locally, the project stimulated media discourse about cultural exchange, increased commercial interest in venues and locations highlighted in the music video, and was connected to charitable activities associated with the Brazil concerts, demonstrating measurable on-the-ground impacts beyond streaming metrics.
