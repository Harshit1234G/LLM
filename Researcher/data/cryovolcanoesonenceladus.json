Similar types of atmosphere exchange\nfrom one body to another, such as O2 and O3 sourced from TRAPPIST-1 d, could be\nintroduced into the upper atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e, and might be interpreted as\nbiosignatures. We simulate this potential false positive for life on TRAPPIST-1 e, by ap-\nplying an external inﬂux of water and oxygen into the top of the atmosphere using a cou-\npled 1-D photochemical-climate model (Atmos), to predict atmospheric composition. In\naddition, synthetic spectral observations are produced with the Planetary Spectrum Gen-\nerator for the James Webb Space Telescope, Origins Space Telescope, Habitable Exo-\nplanet Observatory and Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor to test the detectability of abiotic-\ngenerated O2 and O3 in the presence of abiotic and biotic surface ﬂuxes of CH4. We de-\ntermine that the incoming ﬂux of material needed to trigger detection of abiotic O2/O3\nby any of these observatories is more than two orders of magnitude (1 × 1012 molecules/cm2/s)\nabove what is physically plausible.\nPlain Language Summary\nIn the Saturnian system, Enceladus’ icy volcanoes spew liquid and gassy material\n-including water- into outer space, and some of that material ends up in Titan’s atmo-\nsphere. This is a prominent phenomenon within our solar system that has been observed\nin great detail and shows proof of foreign matter exchange being possible between worlds.\nThe simultaneous presence of detectable amounts of methane and oxygen or ozone in an\natmosphere is considered strong evidence for the presence of life because in a methane\nrich atmosphere, oxygen or ozone will be destroyed to the point of being undetectable\nunless life is present to replenish it and vice-versa. We explore here whether a similar\ntype of matter exchange, with methane present and occurring in the TRAPPIST-1 sys-\ntem, could increase oxygen and water abundances to the point of creating atmospheric\nsignatures that may be mistaken for signs of life on another planet. To probe this ques-\ntion we use computer models of atmospheres and current and next-generation space tele-\nscopes. We conclude that when looking for the simultaneous presence of methane and\noxygen/ozone, this matter exchange will not be mistaken for signs of life.\n1 Introduction\nAs we move closer to being able to characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial ex-\noplanets, the ability to identify signs of life and ﬁlter out false-positive biosignatures will\nbe of the upmost importance. A biosignature is a detectable property of a planet (or en-\nvironment) that results from the presence of life on a planet, and whose detection requires\nthe presence of life (Lederberg, 1965; Lovelock, 1965; Marais & Walter, 1999; Des Marais\net al., 2008; Schwieterman et al., 2018; Meadows et al., 2018). A false-positive biosig-\nnature is a means of producing such a detectable property via non-biological processes\n(Harman & Domagal-Goldman, 2018). Upcoming observatories have the potential to de-\ntect and characterize terrestrial planet atmospheres, and farther-oﬀmission concepts plan\nto look for biosignatures (National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2021). Fauchez\net al. (2020) have shown that for the TRAPPIST-1 planets in the habitable zone it will\nbe challenging to detect water or any biosignature gas with the James Webb Space Tele-\nscope (JWST). However, carbon dioxide could be detectable and serve as a proxy to in-\nfer the presence of an atmosphere. NASA had four mission concepts evaluated for the\nAstro2020 Decadal Survey and three of them (Habitable Exoplanet Observatory, Ori-\ngins Space Telescope and Large Ultra-violet Optical Infrared Surveyor - LUVOIR ) will\nbe able to search for biosignatures on potentially habitable exoplanets (Gaudi et al., 2020;\nCooray et al., 2019; LUVOIR, 2019). The relevant recommendations of the decadal survery\nwere for a ∼6m inscribed diameter Infrared/Optical/Ultraviolet space telescope with a\n–2–\nAn edited version of this paper was published by AGU.

These recommendations, combined with the successful launch\nof JWST, motivate the continued study of biosignature and false-positive biosignature\nsimulations in preparation for observational exoplanet atmosphere data in the near-term\nfuture. Prior work has argued that the presence of oxygen (and/or ozone, which is a pho-\ntochemical byproduct of O2) in combination with methane in an atmosphere is the most\npromising biosignature to look for (Hitchcock & Lovelock, 1967; Lovelock, 1975; Domagal-\nGoldman et al., 2014; Meadows, 2017). This classical “strong” biosignature pair of CH4\nand O2/O3 is considered robust due to their chemical interaction. In an atmosphere where\nO2 is abundant and H2O is present, the hydroxyl radical, OH, is produced which pro-\nmotes the destruction of CH4 by O2 (Levy, 1971) while a CH4-rich atmosphere would\ncontain reducing sinks for O2 that rapidly remove it from the atmosphere. This mutual\ndestruction makes it diﬃcult to maintain detectable levels of O3 in the context of a CH4-\nrich atmosphere without biological O2 ﬂuxes. Therefore the simultaneous presence of CH4\nand O3 is an indicator of biological production of both CH4 and O2.\nBiotic and abiotic sources of atmospheric CH4 and O2 on Earth have been exten-\nsively studied and can help constrain plausible ﬂux ranges for this study. For example\nCH4 can be produced as a metabolic byproduct of microbial life, and this process is evo-\nlutionarily ancient; putative evidence for this metabolism extends all the way back to\n3.5 billion years ago (Ueno et al., 2006). And while Earth’s modern biosphere produces\na biological CH4 ﬂux of ∼1×1011 molecules/cm2/s (Pavlov et al., 2001), estimates for\nthe Archean range from ∼0.3-2.5 times this present-day value (Kharecha et al., 2005).\nCH4 is also produced through geological processes, such as serpentinization, but at lower\nrates (Berndt et al., 1996). This means there is a range of potential CH4 surface ﬂuxes\ndepending on whether they are produced abiotically or biotically (Arney et al., 2018)\nyet both of these forms potentially lead to accumulation of detectable CH4 (Krissansen-\nTotton et al., 2016). This would complicate biosignature characterization eﬀorts and re-\nquire further context about the planet and host star to constrain the magnitude of the\nﬂux and understand its source (Krissansen-Totton et al., 2016; Arney et al., 2018).\nAs reviewed in Meadows (2017), O2 has characteristics of a potential biosignature,\nbut also has known, albeit speciﬁc and detectable, abiotic production mechanisms. These\nabiotic processes include slower O2 and O3 destruction on water (H2O)-poor planets (Gao\net al., 2015), fast O-production via photolysis on CO2-rich planets around certain star\ntypes (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014), and oxidation of the bulk atmosphere, driven by\nmassive hydrogen escape on planets around pre-main sequence M-dwarfs (Luger & Barnes,\n2015). Here we consider an additional potential source of O2/O3: an inﬂux of O from\nspace ﬂowing into the top of the atmosphere (TOA) to form O2 and O3 abiotically.\nTitan provides an example of such an inﬂow, and its impact on atmospheric chem-\nistry. Titan exhibits rich photochemistry, which produces hydrocarbons, nitriles, and a\nhaze of organic material (Brown et al., 2009; Niemann et al., 2010). Titan’s atmosphere\nis known to contain some oxygen, primarily CO. The origin of oxygen-bearing species\nin Titan’s atmosphere remained unresolved until the Cassini-Huygens mission. The Cassini\nPlasma Spectrometer detected a ﬂux of O+ ions into Titan’s atmosphere (Hartle et al.,\n2006), suggesting an external source for Titan’s oxygen-bearing species. The active, H2O-\nrich plumes near Enceladus’ south pole (Porco et al., 2006) and its H2O torus (Hartogh\net al., 2011) provide a likely source. Dissociated and ionized H2O molecules from the plumes\nare transported through the Saturn system supplying oxygen-bearing ions to Titan’s up-\nper atmosphere. The precipitating O+ ions participate in Titan’s photochemistry, and\nare likely responsible for the presence of CO, CO2 (H¨orst et al., 2008; Krasnopolsky, 2009),\nand perhaps even H2O in Titan’s atmosphere (H¨orst et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 2012).\nAtmosphere loss and exchange processes between worlds could be ampliﬁed in plan-\netary systems around very active M stars. In such systems, there is the potential for the\n–3–\nAn edited version of this paper was published by AGU.

The tight pack-\ning of systems like TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2016, 2017) makes it possible for a larger\nportion of that lost atmosphere to be picked up by another close-by planet. Titan and\nEnceladus are approximately 106 km apart, the same order of magnitude as the distance\nbetween TRAPPIST-1 d and e. In this work we study a scenario where an abiotic ex-\noplanet receives an inﬂux of water or atomic oxygen at the TOA from an outside source.\nCombined with an abiotic surface ﬂux of CH4, this creates the potential for both CH4\nand either O2 or O3 to be detected. If both are simultaneously detectable for reasonable\nincoming ﬂux rates, this would represent a false-positive for an biosignature that has pre-\nviously been considered to be “solid.” To investigate the potential for incoming exter-\nnal ﬂuxes into a terrestrial planet’s atmosphere to trigger a CH4-O2/O3 biosignature false-\npositive, we model the atmosphere of an abiotic planet exposed to varying exogenous ﬂuxes\nof O or H2O using the coupled photochemical-climate model, Atmos (Arney et al., 2016).\nWe then use the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG,(Villanueva et al., 2018)) to sim-\nulate transit spectra for those atmospheres, and evaluate the detectability of O2, O3, and\nCH4.\nThe paper is broken down into the following four sections. Section 2 explains the\nmethods and tools used for the project, Section 3 is a presentation of our main data and\nmost pertinent results, Section 4 is where we discuss our results and explain what they\nmean in the context of false-positive biosignatures and ﬁ\n\n---\n\nIndex: 2\nTitle: Enceladus Farm: Can plants grow with Enceladus' water? (Preliminary Report)\nPublished: 2020-03-31\nAuthors: Daigo Shoji\nSource: Arxiv research paper\nContent: –Preliminary Report–\nEnceladus Farm: Can plants grow with Ence-\nladus’ water?\nDaigo Shoji1\n1. Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro-\nku, Tokyo (shoji@elsi.jp)\nAbstract\nEnceladus is a saturnian satellite that should have liquid water inside of it (subsurface\nocean). Measurements and experiments on water plume from Enceladus have revealed\nthat Enceladus’ ocean contains several salts such as NaCl. On the Earth, salt in soil has\nbecome a serious problem for agriculture, and importance of salt-tolerant plants are indi-\ncated. In order to test the eﬀect of Enceladus’ water to terrestrial plant, by hydroponic,\nwe tried to grow three salt-tolerant plants (ice plant, swiss chard and salicornia) simulat-\ning Enceladus’ water (Enceladus Farm project). Using water with 0.33% NaCl and 0.4%\nNaHCO3, which is consistent with the observations of Enceladus, all plants could grow\nif they were germinated and grown with pure water until each plant had a few leaves.\nHowever, growth rate can be suppressed compared with the plants cultivated with pure\nwater. Because our ﬁrst test was performed with loose conditions, more works are needed\nto evaluate the eﬀect of Enceladus’ water to plant growth. However, in addition to the\nworks to grow plants on lunar and martian grounds, Enceladus’ water may be used to\nconsider properties of plant from wider environment.\n1\nIntroduction\nIt has been observed that Enceladus, one of the mid-sized saturnian satellites, emits\nwater plumes to the outer space (Porco et al., 2006). In the plume, salts and nano-silica\nhave also been detected, which strongly implies the interaction between liquid water and\nsilicate core (Postberg et al., 2009, 2011; Hsu et al., 2015) Although the detail is still\n1\narXiv:2003.14131v1  [astro-ph.EP]  31 Mar 2020\nin debate, due to these observations, Enceladus is one of the most probable bodies that\nhave a subsurface ocean. Liquid water is a key factor for generation and habitability\nof organisms. Thus, Enceladus is also an important object for astrobiology as well as\nplanetary science.\nIn the ﬁeld of space engineering, it has been tested whether plants can grow in soil of\nMoon and Mars (Wamelink et al., 2014). When people stay on such bodies in future, one\nserious problem is how we produce foods. If we can grow plants using lunar and martian\nsoil directly, it can be one solution. Unfortunately, although Enceladus is an attractive\nbody for astrobiology, contrast to Moon and Mars, it has not been tested whether plants\ncan grow with Enceladus’ water. This is not surprising because, compared with Moon\nand Mars, Enceladus is not a practical target for humans to live for a long time.\nHowever, liquid water in Enceladus may be used to analyze the properties of plants\non the Earth. Observations found that Enceladus’ ocean contains several salts such as\nNaCl (Postberg et al., 2009, 2011). Recently, salinization in terrestrial ground has been\na very serious problem for agriculture and ecosystem (e.g., Rozema and Flowers, 2008).\nTypical plants cannot live when salt is mixed in soil. Thus, when salinity increases due to\nirrigation or environment change, conventional agriculture cannot be maintained there.\nOne solution to the salinized soil is to grow salt-tolerant plants (Rozema and Flowers,\n2008). As mentioned above, typical plants cannot live in high salinity soil. However,\nseveral plants have the mechanism to grow in the salty environment. If we can grow\nsalt-tolerant plants, agriculture may be possible even on salinized region. In order to test\nthe salt tolerance of plants, many researches have been performed (e.g., Lv et al., 2012).\nIn these works, water and soil conditions are tested focusing on terrestrial environment.\nConsidering terrestrial agriculture, it is not surprising. However, in space engineering,\ntests of plant growth have been performed considering the soil conditions of Moon and\nMars. Rocky and icy bodies in our solar system have diverse environment. Thus, if we\ncan compare plant growth between several bodies’ environment, it may be valuable for\nthe terrestrial agricultural problem as well as space engineering.\nDue to this motivation, we started a new project to grow plants simulating Enceladus’\nwater, which is named ”Enceladus Farm”. As a ﬁrst test, we grew three salt-tolerant\nplants, ice plant, salicornia and swiss chard using NaCl (table salt) and NaHCO3 (baking\nsoda). Because this test is very loose, more works are required in order to check the plant\ngrowth. However, in this work, preliminary results of our ﬁrst test are shown.\n2\n2\nMethod\n2.1\nWater composition\nMeasurements by Cassini probe revealed that Enceladus’ plume is mainly composed of\nthree types of particles (type I: almost pure water ice, type II: signiﬁcant amount of\norganic and/or siliceous material, type III: ice with high sodium content) (Postberg et al.,\n2009, 2011). Of the three types, high sodium particle (type III) was formed by freezing\nof water droplet, which can be the information on composition of the subsurface ocean.\nPostberg et al. (2009) performed experiments on ion spectrum from salt water. By their\nexperiments, the observed spectrum is consistent with the water with 0.05-0.2 mol kg−1\nNaCl and 2-5 times more NaCl than NaHCO3 (Postberg et al., 2009). In order for nano-\nsilica to be formed by cooling of hydrothermal water, pH of Enceladus’ ocean should be\n8.5-10.5, which implies that the maximum salinity is 4% at the boundary between the\nocean and the core (Hsu et al., 2015). Although other salts and chemical materials are\ncontained in Enceladus, for simplicity, we simulated Enceladus’ water only by NaCl and\nNaHCO3, which were obtained from market (Fig. 1). Salinities of NaCl and NaHCO3\nwere set at 0.33 % and 0.4 %, respectively, which are consistent with Postberg et al.\n(2009). Both materials were dissolved into tap water. One caveat is that, in Enceladus’\nocean, ammonia is also contained (Hsu et al., 2015). In this work, as the ﬁrst test, we\nignored ammonia. Thus, pH of the water was ∼8, which is lower than Enceladus’ ocean\n(pH=8.5-10.5) (Hsu et al., 2015).\nThe other caveat is that, in addition to NaCl and\nNaHCO3, we added liquid fertilizer to the salt water because plants cannot grow without\nbasic ingredient such as nitrogen.\n2.2\nCultivation\nBecause the purpose of this ﬁrst test is to check whether salt-tolerant plants can grow\nwith Enceladus-like salt water, as the loose condition, germination of seeds was conducted\nwith pure (tap) water without salts. If the germinated plants can grow, germination with\nsalt water can be a future work. For the germinations of ice plant and swiss chard, seeds\nwere put on cubic sponges (2.5 cm each side) that has cuts at their center (Fig. 2). Seeds\nof salicornia were put to vermiculite because they did not germinate well on the sponge\n(Fig. 2).\nWhen each plant has a few leaves (when height became 2-3 cm in the case of salicornia),\nthey were moved to the water tank ﬁlled with salt (Enceladus-like) water (Fig. 3). Tanks\nwere put in room, and LED lights were used for nine hours per day (Fig. 4). The salt\nwater was changed once a week. However, when the amount of water decreased within\n3\nFigure 1: For the simulation of Enceladus’ ocean, as a ﬁrst step, only NaCl and NaHCO3\nwere used. Both materials were obtained from market.\n4\nFigure 2: Sprouts of three salt-tolerant plants germinated with pure water. For salicornia,\nvermiculite was used because it did not germinate well on sponge.\none week, pure water with liquid fertilizer was ﬁlled in the tanks.\n3\nResults\n3.1\nIce plant\nWe grew two sprouts of ice plant in the salt water tank. For a comparison, two sprouts\nwere also cultivated only with pure(tap) water and liquid fertilizer. Fig. 5 shows the ice\nplants ∼1.5 months after the movement to the salt water tank. Both ice plants could\ngrow and new leaves were generated with the salt water. However, compared with the\nplants grown in the pure water tank, growth rate was reduced. The height of ice plants\nfrom the salt water tank was ∼11 cm and ∼8 cm while the plants from the pure water\ntank had ∼17 cm and ∼13 cm, respectively. The color of leaves also became lighter at the\nsalt water. Although ice plant is salt-tolerant species, chemical materials of Enceladus’\nwater seem to suppress its growth.\n5\nFigure 3: Sprouts moved to salt water tank. When germinated ice plant and swiss chard\nhad a few leaves and salicornia became a few centimeters in height, they were moved to\nthe salt water tank.\n6\nFigure 4: Plants cultivated in salt water tanks. As a comparison, two ice plants were\ncultivated with pure water tank (tap water + liquid fertilizer). Every tank was set in\nroom and LED lights were used for photosynthesis.\n7\nFigure 5: Ice plants about one and a half months after they were moved to the salt water\ntank. Two plants on the right side are the ones cultivated in the pure water tank (One\nplant was moved to the salt water at Jan. 24, 2020, and then one more plant was moved\nat Jan. 31, 2020. The photo was taken at Mar. 19, 2020).\n8\n3.2\nSwiss chard\nSwiss chard also grew in the salt water tank. However, contrast to the progressive growth\nof leaves, the base of the stem became brown. Although the reason of the color change\nis uncertain, when swiss chard grew upward, it fell several times. Thus, the stem might\nbe damaged due to the falls and the salt in water. Due to this color change, we moved\nthe plant to pure water, and then new roots were generated upside of the brown stem.\nBecause the chard began to grow further with pure water, after two weeks, it was moved\nto the salt water tank again. Although it was cultivated with pure water for two weeks,\nfor one and a half months, the height of the chard became from a few centimeters to ∼20\ncm with the salt water (Fig. 6).\nFigure 6: Swiss chard about one and a half months after they were moved to the salt\nwater tank (the plant was moved to the salt water at Jan. 31, 2020 and the photo was\ntaken at Mar. 24, 2020). Because the base of the stem became brown, it was moved to\npure water between Feb. 20, 2020 and Mar. 5, 2020.\n9\n3.3\nSalicornia\nWe moved three germinated sprouts of salicornia from vermiculite to the salt water tank.\nAlthough salicornia also grew with the salt water, in our cultivation, the growth speed\nwas slow. For ∼1.5 months, the height of salicornia became ∼5 cm (approximately 4.5\ncm, 4.0 cm, 6 cm, respectively) (Fig. 7). It has been indicated that salicornia is one of\nthe strongest plants to salt (e.g., Lv et al., 2012). In addition to the plants in the salt\nwater tank, we left several sprouts in vermiculite without moving to the salt water tank,\nand cultivated them with 2% NaCl water (NaHCO3 was not included). Although growth\nrate was diﬀerent between each plant, several sprouts grew higher than the plants in the\nsalt water tank. While ice plant hates salt even though it is tolerant, salicornia seems to\nuse salt to increase its growth. Although the growth speed is slow, salicornia may best\nmatch with Enceladus’ water of three species.\nFigure 7: Salicornia about one and a half months after they were moved to the salt water\ntank (the plants were moved to the salt water at Feb. 7, 2020 and the photo was taken\nat Mar. 26, 2020).\n10\n4\nSummary\nSo far, Enceladus is one of the most probable celestial bodies that have the subsurface\nocean (e.g., Porco et al., 2006; Postberg et al., 2009, 2011). From the analyses of observed\nplume, Enceladus’ ocean seems to contain salts such as NaCl and carbonate (Postberg\net al., 2009, 2011).\nIn order to test whether plants can grow with Enceladus’ water,\nby hydroponic, we tried to cultivate three salt-tolerant plants (ice plant, swiss chard,\nsalicornia) with 0.33% NaCl and 0.4% NaHCO3 using table salt and baking soda.\nIf\nsprouts germinated with pure water were moved to the salt water, all three plants could\ngrow. However, compared with the plants cultivated with pure water, growth can be\nsuppressed in the c\n\n---\n\nIndex: 3\nTitle: An Investigation of Libration Heating and the Thermal State of Enceladus's Ice Shell\nPublished: 2021-12-13\nAuthors: Wencheng D.

Forced librations can enhance tidal dissipation in the ice shell, but how such \nlibrations affect the thermal state of Enceladus has not been investigated. Here we investigate \nthe heating effect of forced librations using the model of Van Hoolst et al. (2013), which \nincludes the elasticity of the ice shell. We find that libration heating in the ice shell is \ninsufficient to match the inferred conductive heat loss of Enceladus. This suggests that either \nEnceladus is not in a thermal steady state, or additional heating mechanisms beneath the ice \nshell are contributing the bulk of the power. In the presence of such an additional heat source, \nEnceladus resides in a stable thermal equilibrium, resisting small perturbations to the shell \nthickness. Our results do not support the occurrence of a runaway melting process proposed \nby Luan and Goldreich (2017). In our study, the strong dependence of conductive loss on \nshell thickness stabilizes the thermal state of Enceladus’s ice shell. Our study implies that \nthermal runaway (if it occurred) or episodic heating on Enceladus is unlikely to originate \nfrom librations of the ice shell. \n1. Introduction \nEnceladus is the third geologically active body whose internal heat can be detected by \nremote sensing (Spencer et al. 2006), following the Earth and Io. A high heat flow, ~5-15 GW, \nis observed by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) on the south polar terrain \n(SPT) of Enceladus (Spencer et al. 2006, 2013; Howett et al. 2011). Gravity, shape and \nlibration data from Cassini demonstrate the existence of a global subsurface ocean (e.g., Iess \net al. 2014; Beuthe et al. 2016; Thomas et al. 2016; Čadek et al. 2016). If the freezing point of \nthe ocean is close to 273 K, the implied conductive heat flow is a few tens of GW at present \n(Hemingway et al. 2018). Thus, if Enceladus is now in steady state and the ocean is not \nfreezing with time, a corresponding endogenic heat production must be taking place. \nBecause radiogenic heating at Enceladus is only ~0.3 GW (Roberts and Nimmo 2008), by \nfar the most likely heat source is tidal dissipation. Until recently, it was unclear whether \nsufficient tidal heat was available. However, recent astrometric results (e.g., Lainey et al. \n2020) have demonstrated that Saturn is transferring energy and momentum to its orbiting \nsatellites at a much higher rate than previously thought (Meyer and Wisdom 2007). Thus, \neven with the current small eccentricity, tidal dissipation can be sufficient to maintain \nEnceladus in a conductively steady state (Fuller et al. 2016; Nimmo et al. 2018).  \nHowever, several puzzles remain. One is where in Enceladus the tidal heat is dissipated. \nInitial studies focused on the ice shell (e.g., Roberts and Nimmo 2008; Shoji et al. 2013; \nBěhounková et al. 2015), but more recent studies have found it difficult to generate enough \nheat in the ice shell (Souček et al. 2016; Beuthe 2019). Instead, water-filled fractures (Kite \nand Rubin 2016), the ocean beneath (Chen and Nimmo 2011; Tyler 2011; Wilson and \nKerswell 2018; Rovira-Navarro et al. 2019, 2020), or the porous silicate core (Roberts 2015; \nChoblet et al. 2017; Liao et al. 2020) have been suggested as alternatives. A second is \nwhether Enceladus is actually in steady state. In principle, tidal-orbital feedbacks can arise \nand generate time-variable heating rates and eccentricities (e.g., Ojakangas and Stevenson \n1986). Furthermore, the presence of deformed terrains with indications of high heat flux \nelsewhere on Enceladus (Giese et al. 2008) suggests some kind of time-variable behaviour. \n3 \n \nWe will examine both of these questions through the prism of ice shell librations. \n In a reference frame fixed to the surface of Enceladus, librations result in a periodic \nmotion of Saturn across the sky. Librations can be either physical - variations in the ice shell \nrotation rate, driven by time-variable torques from the primary – or optical – driven by the \ntime-variable orbital speed of Enceladus in its eccentric orbit (Hurford et al. 2009). Either \nkind results in motion of the tidal bulge relative to the solid surface and can thus produce \ndeformation and heating. In general, librations are forced at various distinct periods arising \nfrom the various orbital periodicities. However, Enceladus also has free libration periods, the \nnatural frequencies of the system. In the case of an ice shell, the natural frequency depends on \nthe ice shell thickness. As with any oscillator, if the natural libration frequency is close to the \nforcing frequency, resonant amplification will occur. \nAn early suggestion that Enceladus’s high heating rate was driven by a 3:1 libration \nresonance (Wisdom 2004) was not borne out by subsequent Cassini gravity measurements. \nRambaux et al. (2011) investigated forced librations at Europa and argued that a similar \nresonance might occur, with the very interesting possibility of a thermal runaway. However, \nthis paper did not include the effect of a shell of finite rigidity on the libration amplitude (cf. \nVan Hoolst et al. 2013). Luan and Goldreich (2017) proposed a thermal runaway for \nEnceladus. Eccentricity growth of Enceladus produces more tidal dissipation and melts the \nice shell. The thinner ice shell in turn leads to enhancement of tidal dissipation. Runaway \nmelting follows until the decrease of shell thickness leads to large eccentricity damping. One \ngoal of our study is to investigate whether a libration-driven thermal runaway could take \nplace at Enceladus or whether thermal equilibrium of the ice shell can be maintained against \nsmall perturbations. \nRambaux et al. (2010) investigated forced librations at Enceladus, but their results did not \ninclude the effect of a subsurface ocean. As shown by Van Hoolst et al. (2013), inclusion of \nan ocean overlain by an elastic shell can completely change the librational response of a body. \nVan Hoolst et al. (2016) included this effect in their study of Enceladus’s librations but did \nnot address the issue of heat generation. This is because the present-day libration amplitude is \nknown (Thomas et al. 2016) and is too small to generate sufficient heat. However, since \nEnceladus’s eccentricity and libration amplitudes could have been higher in the past, we wish \nto investigate whether a thermal runaway could have operated recently, so that it is \ncontributing to the present-day energy budget.   \n \nIn this work we calculate the forced librations of Enceladus’s ice shell using the model of \nVan Hoolst et al. (2013). We compare the resulting ice shell tidal dissipation rate to the \npresent-day heat flow on Enceladus to understand the thermal state of Enceladus. We find, in \ncommon with other studies, that the ice shell heating is insufficient to compensate for the \nhigh conductive heat loss on Enceladus. We then investigate whether a thermal runaway of \nthe kind proposed above could occur on Enceladus. We find that even with a higher \neccentricity in the past, Enceladus could have been in a stable, high-heat-flux equilibrium \nresistant to small perturbations, and that no thermal runaway is likely. \n \nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and data we use \nto calculate the forced libration amplitude of Enceladus. Sections 3 and 4 present the forced \nlibrations at different frequencies. Section 5 shows the librational heating. Section 6 discusses \nthe possible thermal states of Enceladus. Section 7 summarizes the main results of this work.  \n4 \n \n2. Methodology \nWe follow the elastic libration model established by Van Hoolst et al. (2013, hereafter \nVB13) to calculate the forced libration amplitude. This model is developed for a tidally \nlocked satellite with three homogeneous layers: an ice shell, a subsurface ocean and a rocky \ncore. Compared to previous libration models assuming infinite rigidity of the ice shell (e.g., \nVan Hoolst et al. 2009; Rambaux et al. 2011), this model includes the effect of the finite \nelasticity of the shell. \nIn this libration model, the gravitational torques the satellite experiences can be divided \ninto two major parts. One is the total torque applied by the external gravitational potential on \nboth the periodic and static bulges \nΓ𝑡𝑡= 3\n2\n𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓−𝑘𝑘2\n𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓\n(𝐵𝐵−𝐴𝐴) 𝐺𝐺𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝\n𝑑𝑑3 sin 2𝜓𝜓,\n(𝐸𝐸1) \nwhere 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓 and 𝑘𝑘2 are the fluid Love number and classical dynamical Love number. (𝐵𝐵−\n𝐴𝐴) is the equatorial moment-of-inertia difference. 𝐺𝐺 is the gravitational constant, 𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝 is the \nmass of the primary, and 𝑑𝑑 is the distance between the satellite and the primary. 𝜓𝜓 is the \nangle between the long axis of the satellite and the direction to the primary. This external \ntorque expression is from equation (12 or 30) in VB13 and is applicable for each internal \nlayer of the satellite. To get an expression for a specific layer, Love numbers, \nmoment-of-inertia difference and the angle 𝜓𝜓 need to be specified for that layer. Note that if \nthe satellite has no rigidity, then k2=kf and the total torque is zero. \nThe other part is the torques between internal layers. The pressure torque from the \nsubsurface ocean can be divided into two components which can be incorporated into the \nexpressions of the external and internal gravitational torques. The combined effect of the \nexternal gravitational torque above and the contribution from the oceanic pressure torque is \nΓ𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑖𝑖= 3\n2 ቈ(𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖) 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓\n𝑖𝑖−𝑘𝑘2\n𝑖𝑖\n𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓\n𝑖𝑖\n+ (𝐵𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜−𝐴𝐴𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜) 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓\n𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜−𝑘𝑘2\n𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜\n𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓\n𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜\n቉𝐺𝐺𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝\n𝑑𝑑3 sin 2𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖,\n(𝐸𝐸2) \nfor the rocky core. Subscript or superscript 𝑖𝑖 represents the core (or the rocky interior), and \n𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 refers to the bottom of the ocean. This expression is from equation (34) in VB13. A \nsimilar expression can be written for the ice shell layer, with subscript or superscript \nsubstituted. \nThe other component of the oceanic pressure torque goes into the expression of the \ninternal gravitational torque. The final expression of the internal torque including the \ncontribution from the pressure torque and associated with the static bulge is \nΓ𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑖𝑖\n𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠= 4𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋\n5  [(𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖−𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖) + (𝐵𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜−𝐴𝐴𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜)][𝜌𝜌𝑜𝑜𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜+ 𝜌𝜌𝑠𝑠(𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠−𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜)] sin 2(𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠−𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖) , (𝐸𝐸3) \nwhere subscript or superscript o and s represent the ocean layer and the shell layer, \nrespectively. 𝜌𝜌 and 𝛽𝛽 are the density and the equatorial flattening. 𝛾𝛾 is the small libration \nangle. This expression is from Eq. (37) in VB13. This expression is the internal torque \nexerted on the core, and the same torque with an opposite direction is exerted on the shell. \nThe internal torque associated with the periodic bulge and including the contribution from the \npressure torque is  \n5 \n \nΓ𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑖𝑖\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝= 2𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜+ 2𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖−2𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠,\n(𝐸𝐸4) \nfor the core layer. Here the coefficients 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 refer to equation (39-41) in VB13. \n𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is the oscillation part of the true longitude at the diurnal frequency (refer to equation (11) \nin Rambaux et al. 2011). This expression is from equation (38) in VB13. A torque equal to \n(E4) but with an opposite direction is exerted on the shell layer. Note that here we only \nconsi\n\n---\n",

    "abstract": "Enceladus' cryovolcanic plumes provide direct evidence of an active subsurface ocean and ongoing exchange of volatiles into the Saturnian system. Cassini measurements reveal plumes composed of water vapor/ice, salts (notably NaCl and carbonate species), organics and nanosilica, implying hydrothermal interaction and a salty, alkaline ocean. Plume material forms a planetary-scale water torus and supplies oxygen-bearing ions (e.g., O+) that modify neighboring atmospheres (Titan), showing inter-body volatile transfer. Using these solar-system processes as analogues, coupled photochemical-climate modeling (Atmos) and synthetic spectral generation (PSG) were applied to assess whether exogenous H2O/O influx could produce abiotic O2/O3 in CH4-rich exoplanet atmospheres and thereby yield false-positive biosignatures; results indicate required external fluxes (>~1×10^12 molecules cm−2 s−1) exceed plausible values by >100×, so such false positives are unlikely in realistic scenarios. Investigations of internal heating using an elastic-shell libration model show that libration-driven dissipation in the ice shell cannot supply the tens of GW of heat inferred at the south pole, implying dominant dissipation occurs in the ocean, localized fractures, or the silicate core; libration-driven thermal runaway is disfavored and the shell is thermally stabilized against small perturbations. Complementary laboratory work simulating Enceladus-like water chemistry demonstrates biological stress on terrestrial halophytes but survival in some species, highlighting the plume composition's astrobiological relevance and its utility as an analog for salinity studies. Together, observations, modeling and experiments refine understanding of plume composition, heat sources driving cryovolcanism, and the broader implications for atmospheric exchange and biosignature interpretation.",
    "conclusion": "Enceladus' cryovolcanism is rooted in an active, geochemically rich subsurface ocean that ejects water, salts, organics and silicate-derived particles into space, enabling inter-body volatile transfer (e.g., to Titan). Modeling shows that while such exchange can introduce oxidants into an atmosphere, exogenous fluxes required to produce detectable abiotic O2/O3 alongside CH4 on an exoplanet are implausibly large, preserving the robustness of the CH4+O2/O3 biosignature in most realistic cases. Libration-induced heating of the ice shell cannot account for the observed high heat flux; primary dissipation likely resides in the ocean, fractures, or core, which has direct implications for sustaining plumes. Preliminary laboratory simulations of Enceladus-like water underscore the biological impact of plume chemistry and provide useful terrestrial analogs but are limited by simplified chemistry and short durations. Overall, combined observational, theoretical and experimental evidence supports a picture of Enceladus as an ocean world with active geologic and chemical exchange, driven by internal dissipation distinct from shell librations, and with modest risk that its plume-mediated atmospheric exchange will produce exoplanet biosignature false positives under realistic conditions."

    "## Observations and Composition of Enceladus' Cryovolcanic Plumes\n\nCassini observations established Enceladus as an active cryovolcanic body with sustained plumes that eject a mixture of water vapor, ice grains, organic-rich particles, salts (notably NaCl), and nanoscale silica particles originating from a subsurface ocean [1,2]. These multi-component ejecta were characterized by both in situ mass spectrometry and remote dust analyses, which together revealed complex particle populations that record the physical and chemical state of liquid water reservoirs beneath the icy shell [1,2]. The presence of nanosilica and salt-bearing grains links plume material directly to aqueous processes at depth and indicates exchange between liquid water and silicate materials at the seafloor [2,1].\n\nMaterial launched from Enceladus does not remain confined to the immediate plume environment but becomes incorporated into a system-scale water vapor and particle torus around Saturn; subsequent photodissociation and magnetospheric processes convert portions of this material into dissociated and ionized species such as O+ that are entrained in Saturn’s magnetosphere [1]. The flux of neutral and charged oxygen-bearing material from Enceladus thus provides a mechanism for inter-body transport of volatiles and for chemical modification of neighboring atmospheres and surfaces, with implications for moons such as Titan [1].\n\nChemical inferences drawn from plume composition point to an alkaline subsurface ocean with inferred pH values in the approximate range 8.5–10.5, consistent with ongoing hydrothermal interactions between seawater and silicate rock and with the presence of carbonate species in the aqueous chemistry [1]. Ammonia has been implicated by some analyses as a component of the interior volatile inventory, although simplified laboratory simulations occasionally omit ammonia to isolate other chemical behaviors; collectively, plume ejection, droplet freezing, and particle formation processes preserve signatures of liquid–rock interactions and therefore serve as diagnostic probes of interior geochemistry and potential habitability [1,2].\n\n### Plume particle types and inferred ocean chemistry\n\nCassini mass spectra and dust analyses distinguish three principal plume particle classes: nearly pure water-ice grains, organic- or siliceous-rich particles, and sodium-rich ice particles (often termed “type III” grains) whose salt signatures are interpreted as arising from the freezing of salty droplets during ejection and freezing [2,1]. The identification of sodium-rich particles is particularly diagnostic because their salt content can be linked quantitatively to dissolved salt concentrations in the source liquid, thereby providing one of the primary observational constraints on ocean salinity [2,1].\n\nLaboratory fits to the Cassini particle data yield estimates of dissolved NaCl concentrations broadly consistent with 0.05–0.2 mol kg−1 NaCl, and the inferred relative abundances of NaCl versus NaHCO3 support a model of a salty, alkaline ocean containing carbonate species [2,1]. These compositional constraints are derived by comparing measured particle signatures with laboratory analogs of freezing salty droplets and mixed salt precipitates, allowing interpretation of the plume particle classes in terms of the source aqueous chemistry.\n\nThe detection of nanoscale silica particles in plume material provides independent evidence for high-temperature fluid–rock interactions at the seafloor, as such particles are most plausibly produced by hydrothermal alteration or silica precipitation under elevated-temperature conditions; this observation is therefore consistent with an active silicate–water interface beneath the ocean and supports interpretations of ongoing hydrothermal activity [2,1].\n\n### Plume dynamics and system-scale transport\n\nMaterial ejected by Enceladus’ plumes contributes to a large-scale circum-Saturnian torus of water vapor and ice particles; within Saturn’s magnetosphere this neutral material undergoes dissociation and ionization, producing species such as O+ and other oxygen-bearing ions that are picked up by magnetospheric plasma flows and can be transported away from Enceladus [1]. These processes convert condensable plume constituents into charged and reactive species that participate in magnetospheric chemistry and dynamics [1].\n\nThe external delivery of oxygen-bearing volatiles and ions from Enceladus constitutes a viable mechanism for exogenous supply of oxidants and other species to neighboring moons and their atmospheres, thereby enabling cross-moon chemical coupling; for example, this supply has been invoked as a pathway for modifying the neutral and ionic composition of Titan’s surrounding environment [1]. Such system-scale transport emphasizes that Enceladus’ plume activity has consequences that extend beyond the local venting regions to influence Saturnian system chemistry and surface–atmosphere interactions on other satellites [1].",
    "## Atmospheric Exchange from Enceladus Plumes and Implications for Biosignature Detection\n\nEnceladus plumes are observed to inject H2O and oxygen-bearing ions into Saturn's magnetosphere, demonstrating a natural mechanism by which volatile-rich material can be transferred from a satellite into a surrounding planetary environment [1]. This solar-system example motivates consideration of analogous processes in compact exoplanetary systems, where material exchanged among closely spaced bodies could, in principle, deliver oxidants such as atomic O and O2 to neighboring atmospheres and thereby alter their redox balance [1]. The Titan–Enceladus system serves as a practical analogue for evaluating whether such exogenous H2O/O influxes could produce detectable abiotic O2 or O3 features in atmospheres that also contain CH4, potentially generating false-positive biosignatures [1].\n\nTo address this question quantitatively, the study employed coupled one-dimensional photochemical–climate modeling and synthetic spectral generation to simulate the atmospheric response of a TRAPPIST-1 e analog to imposed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) influxes of H2O or atomic O, together with prescribed surface CH4 fluxes representing abiotic and biotic scenarios [1]. The modeling framework allowed computation of steady-state atmospheric compositions under a range of imposed external fluxes and provided inputs for transit-spectrum synthesis to assess observational detectability with current and proposed facilities [1]. Synthetic spectra were generated to represent observations by JWST as well as by prospective future missions (Origins, Habitable Exoplanet Observatory variants, and LUVOIR-class concepts), enabling translation of modeled atmospheric compositions into instrument-specific detectability thresholds for O2, O3, and CH4 [1].\n\nThe principal result is that the external influx required to yield detectable abiotic O2/O3 in the simultaneous presence of CH4 — the classic strong biosignature combination — is on the order of ≳1×10^12 molecules cm−2 s−1, a magnitude more than two orders of magnitude higher than exogenous fluxes considered physically plausible based on the Titan–Enceladus analogue and related estimates [1]. Consequently, while atmospheric exchange processes should be considered when interpreting potential biosignature gases, Titan-like material transfer among close-in bodies is unlikely, under realistic fluxes, to mimic the robust CH4+O2/O3 biosignature on terrestrial exoplanets of the type studied [1].\n\n### Modeling approach and detectability tests\n\nThe atmospheric calculations used a coupled 1-D photochemical–climate model (Atmos) to compute steady-state compositions for a TRAPPIST-1 e analog subject to a range of imposed TOA influxes of water (H2O) and atomic oxygen, while surface CH4 fluxes were prescribed to represent both abiotic and biotic supply rates [1]. This approach permitted explicit evaluation of how externally supplied oxidants alter vertical chemical profiles and the production or destruction pathways of O2 and O3 in the presence of CH4 under self-consistent radiative–chemical conditions [1]. By varying the magnitude and composition of the external influxes, the model identified the atmospheric response regimes relevant to potential false-positive scenarios.\n\nFor assessing observability, synthetic transit spectra were produced using the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) for instrument concepts including JWST and several future mission designs (Origins, Habitable Exoplanet Observatory concepts, and LUVOIR-class telescopes), allowing direct comparison of modeled molecular abundances with detection capabilities [1]. From these spectra, detectability thresholds for O2, O3, and CH4 were derived, and the threshold external fluxes necessary to produce a detectable abiotic O2/O3 signature in the presence of CH4 were determined. These modeled detectability thresholds were then compared against plausible exogenous flux magnitudes inferred from the solar-system Titan–Enceladus analogue to evaluate realism [1].\n\n### Implications for exoplanet biosignature interpretation\n\nThe Titan–Enceladus analogue confirms that moons and closely interacting bodies can supply exogenous oxygen-bearing species to a planetary environment, underscoring the conceptual possibility of oxidant delivery influencing atmospheric composition [1]. However, extrapolation to compact exoplanet systems indicates that the external fluxes required to generate detectable abiotic O2/O3 while CH4 remains present are extremely large and, given present understanding of plausible exchange rates, implausible for producing the CH4+O2/O3 combination as a false positive [1]. Therefore, the simultaneous detection of CH4 together with O2 or O3 on an exoplanet continues to constitute a robust biosignature in most realistic scenarios examined, although comprehensive interpretation must still consider atmospheric context and other abiotic O2 production pathways on a case-by-case basis [1].",
    "## Internal Heating, Libration Heating, and the Thermal State of Enceladus\n\nObserved surface heat loss from Enceladus is concentrated in the south polar terrain and has been estimated at roughly 5–15 GW, a magnitude that requires significant endogenic heat production to sustain; radiogenic heating alone is far too small (on the order of 0.3 GW) to account for the measured flux, which identifies tidal dissipation as the leading candidate source of internal heat [3]. Forced librations of an elastic ice shell provide one mechanism by which orbital and rotational forcing can be converted into mechanical deformation and internal heat, motivating quantitative assessment of libration-driven dissipation using models that include the shell, a subsurface ocean, and the rocky core [3]. Detailed calculations using an elastic-shell plus ocean framework adapted from Van Hoolst et al. (2013) indicate, however, that dissipation confined to the ice shell through forced libration is insufficient to match the tens of gigawatts inferred from conductive heat-loss estimates [3].\n\nThe dissipation produced by librational deformation depends strongly on several structural and dynamical parameters, including shell thickness and rigidity, libration amplitudes, and the proximity of forcing frequencies to natural libration frequencies (resonances). The modeling explicitly incorporates external gravitational torques acting on both static and periodic tidal bulges, oceanic pressure torques that modify the effective external and internal torques, and internal gravitational and pressure torques that couple motions among the shell, ocean, and core; the mathematical formulation draws on Love-number-like responses, equatorial moment differences, densities, and flattenings to quantify these contributions [3]. While resonant amplification of libration-driven dissipation is possible in principle when forcing frequencies approach the shell’s natural libration frequency, the combined effects of shell elasticity and ocean coupling substantially alter resonance behavior and place limits on the degree of heating achievable through this mechanism [3].\n\nBecause computed libration heating in the shell falls well short of the level required to balance the inferred conductive losses, the results focus attention on alternative loci of dissipation beneath or within the shell. Ocean tidal dissipation, dissipation within water-filled fractures that penetrate the ice shell, and heating within a porous rocky core (for example via hydrothermal processes) emerge as the more plausible primary contributors to the observed heat flow and to support of sustained plume activity and cryovolcanism, rather than shell libration dissipation alone [3]. Additionally, the strong dependence of conductive heat loss on shell thickness produces a tendency toward thermal stability—small perturbations in shell thickness are resisted rather than amplified—making a libration-driven thermal runaway state unlikely under the modeled conditions, even when considering higher past orbital eccentricities [3].\n\n### Methodology: elastic libration model and torque balances\n\nThe analysis applied the Van Hoolst et al. (2013) elastic-layer libration formalism to a three-layer structural model of Enceladus composed of an elastic ice shell, a subsurface global ocean, and a rocky core, with the objective of computing forced libration amplitudes and the attendant tidal dissipation localized within the ice shell [3]. Within this framework each layer’s rotational response and mutual interactions are represented so that the amplitude of forced libration and the spatial distribution of deformation in the shell can be determined for specified structural and rheological parameters [3]. Dissipation rates are then inferred from the time-varying strains and stresses in the elastic shell under the imposed librational forcing [3].\n\nKey torque contributions included in the computations are: (a) external gravitational torques acting on both the permanent (static) and time-varying (periodic) tidal bulges of the body, (b) pressure torques exerted by the subsurface ocean that modify both the external torque transmitted to the shell and the internal torque balance between layers, and (c) internal gravitational and pressure torques that provide coupling between the shell, ocean, and core degrees of freedom. The mathematical expressions used to represent these torques reference parameters analogous to dynamical Love numbers, differences in equatorial moments of inertia, as well as layer densities and flattenings to capture the coupled rotational–tidal response [3].\n\nThe model permits exploration of resonant behavior in which forcing frequencies approach the shell’s natural libration frequency, a condition that can, in principle, amplify libration amplitudes and dissipation. However, the inclusion of shell elasticity and the modifying influence of the ocean coupling changes the resonance characteristics relative to a rigid-shell picture, broadening or shifting resonance responses and thereby limiting the maximum dissipation attainable through libration of an elastic shell coupled to a global ocean [3].\n\n### Results and implications for heat budget\n\nAcross plausible ranges of shell thickness, rigidity, and libration amplitude, the computed libration-driven dissipation confined to the elastic ice shell is far too small to supply the tens of gigawatts required to offset the conductive heat losses inferred for the south polar terrain; this shortfall implies that shell-libration dissipation cannot be the dominant heat source sustaining the observed thermal and cryovolcanic activity [3]. The calculations further show that conductive heat loss depends strongly on shell thickness in a manner that tends to stabilize the shell: increases in heat loss with thinning are countered by the feedbacks in the modeled thermal balance, making the system resistant to small perturbations and rendering a libration-driven thermal runaway unlikely under the explored parameter space, including scenarios with higher past orbital eccentricities [3].\n\nGiven these findings, the most viable explanations for the majority of Enceladus’s heat budget lie in dissipation occurring beneath the shell or in localized zones: tidal dissipation distributed in the global ocean, viscous or turbulent dissipation within water-filled fractures that penetrate the shell, and heating within a porous or reactive silicate core are identified as the primary candidate mechanisms capable of supplying the required energy to sustain persistent plume output and cryovolcanic phenomena [3]. Consequently, models of Enceladus’s activity and thermal evolution should prioritize these subsurface and localized dissipation pathways rather than attributing the bulk of the heat to libration-driven dissipation confined to the elastic shell [3].",
    "## Laboratory Simulation of Enceladus Ocean Water: Agronomic and Astrobiological Notes\n\nPreliminary hydroponic experiments were conducted using a simplified Enceladus-like aqueous formulation prepared by dissolving commercially available salts in tap water to reach 0.33% NaCl and 0.4% NaHCO3, producing a solution with an approximate pH of 8 when made from tap water; ammonia and other plume constituents were omitted from the preparation [2]. The experimental work tested post-germination tolerance of three salt-tolerant terrestrial species—ice plant, swiss chard, and salicornia—by germinating seeds in pure water and then transplanting seedlings into saline tanks that contained the simplified Enceladus-like solution with added liquid fertilizer to supply nitrogen and baseline nutrients [2]. These design choices were explicitly intended as an initial test of growth following germination rather than as a full simulation of Enceladus ocean chemistry or of seed germination under saline conditions [2].\n\nAll three species survived transplantation into the simulated Enceladus salinity and produced new leaves, demonstrating that the simplified formulation can support at least short-term plant metabolism after germination [2]. However, compared with control plants maintained in pure water, transplanted individuals exhibited reduced growth rates and physiological stress manifested as leaf discoloration and stem damage, indicating measurable biological impacts of the saline chemistry used in this study [2]. Among the tested taxa, the halophytic salicornia showed the best tolerance and the greatest potential for continued growth under the chosen Enceladus-like salinity, whereas ice plant and swiss chard displayed more pronounced reductions in stature and visible damage associated with salt exposure [2].\n\nThe authors emphasize multiple caveats to interpretation: the experiments are preliminary and the simplified salt mixture omits constituents inferred from plume and interior models—specifically ammonia, trace organics, and silicates—so the results should not be read as a direct statement about Enceladus habitability [2]. The use of added fertilizer and the choice to germinate seeds in pure water further limit extrapolation to scenarios in which native seeding and nutrient regimes differ from the experiment [2]. Nevertheless, the findings illustrate that Enceladus-like aqueous chemistry is biologically impactful and that such simplified analogs can be useful both for terrestrial salinity tolerance research and for framing considerations about in situ resource utilization constraints in conceptual mission studies, while underscoring the need for longer-term experiments and inclusion of the neglected constituents to support fuller astrobiological or agricultural conclusions [2].\n\n### Experimental design and chemical simplifications\n\nThe simulated Enceladus water for the hydroponic trials was created by dissolving NaCl and NaHCO3 at concentrations guided by Cassini-derived estimates—specifically 0.33% NaCl and 0.4% NaHCO3—in tap water, yielding a solution with pH near 8 when prepared from tap water; this composition and pH differ from some inferences about deeper Enceladus ocean values because ammonia and other plume constituents were omitted from the preparation [2]. The choice to omit ammonia and other constituents was an explicit simplification of the chemistry for this preliminary test and results in a solution that is chemically simpler and likely less alkaline than some inferred interior compositions [2].\n\nTo provide baseline nutrient availability for transplanted seedlings, a liquid fertilizer was added to the saline tanks so that nitrogen and essential macronutrients were available during the post-germination growth phase [2]. Seeds were germinated in pure water and only after seedling establishment were individuals transplanted into the synthesized saline tanks, making the experimental design specifically a test of salt tolerance after germination rather than a test of germination in saline or fully representative Enceladus-like conditions [2].\n\n### Findings, limitations, and implications\n\nTransplanted seedlings of ice plant, swiss chard, and salicornia all survived and produced new leaves under the simulated Enceladus salinity, demonstrating that the simplified salt mixture can sustain short-term plant growth after germination [2]. At the same time, all species showed evidence of physiological stress—manifested as suppressed growth rates, leaf discoloration, and stem damage—relative to controls maintained in pure water, indicating that the chosen aqueous chemistry exerts biologically significant stress on nonadapted terrestrial plants [2]. Among the tested species, salicornia, a halophyte, exhibited the greatest tolerance and appears to hold the most potential for growth under the specific salinity conditions employed in this study, whereas ice plant and swiss chard showed more severe reductions in height and visible tissue damage associated with salt exposure [2].\n\nThe study authors note that these results are preliminary and do not constitute a direct assessment of Enceladus habitability; rather, they argue that Enceladus-like water chemistry can serve as an experimental analog useful for terrestrial salinity tolerance research and for framing constraints on in situ resource utilization in conceptual mission scenarios [2]. Robust astrobiological or agricultural conclusions will require experiments that include the presently neglected plume-derived constituents such as ammonia, trace organics, and silicates, that examine long-term exposures, and that assess germination and full life-cycle performance under saline conditions rather than only post-germination tolerance [2]."
