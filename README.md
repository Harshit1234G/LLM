# ‚ú® LLM Projects Repository
This repository contains my work and learning journey with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It includes basic explorations, as well as complete AI projects built using modern LLM tools and frameworks.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
1. **Basics**: A collection of introductory implementations and experiments with Hugging Face, Sentence Transformers, Ollama, LangChain, LangGraph, prompt engineering, and a simple RAG system.

2. **NeuroHarshit**: An AI-powered personal portfolio assistant built using RAG. Designed to answer questions about my background, projects, skills, and experience.

3. **Researcher**: An Agentic AI Research Assistant. Uses multiple coordinated agents for information retrieval, validation, and report generation in academic style.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contents
- Foundational LLM concepts and experiments.
- End-to-end projects showcasing RAG systems and agentic workflows.
- Cleanly structured code with dedicated README files in each folder for details.

## üåø Learning Resources
A major part of this journey has been understanding both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical tools** behind LLMs.
The resources I followed cover topics such as:
- Core concepts: Transformers, attention mechanisms, tokenization, vector embeddings.
- Advanced methods: RLHF, RAG, and fine-tuning strategies.
- Practical tutorials: Hugging Face, LangChain, prompt engineering, MCP server, and more.

To organize my learning, I created a **YouTube playlist** (24 videos) that brings together these diverse resources in one place.
